\f0\fs24 \cf0 Permanently Remove Debts in Days or Less\
There's\
a Trump loophole that started in March\
that you can use to have negative\
adverse accounts that are currently on\
your personal credit reports You can\
have them permanently removed if as if\
they never existed at all So I have a\
lot to get to So let's get started\
[Music]\
All right So in full disclosure this is\
kind of an inadvertent haphazard rule or\
law rather that took place around three\
years ago and it was kind of not put in\
place really well and it kind of wasn't\
used as well as people could use it And\
so you're probably wondering Hanukkah it\
makes some sense here Hello So here's\
the deal Most of you know that you don't\
have to worry about medical bills piling\
up on your personal credit anymore\
because thanks to a little known law\
back in\
you can actually have medical\
stuff taken off your personal credit as\
if it never existed This includes\
hospital bills This includes you know\
anything that has to do with medical Now\
stay with me because you're probably\
thinking "Well Monica I don't have\
anything medical or there are no medical\
things related to anything medical that\
I can claim on my personal credit right\
now." Well listen to me very carefully\
because you might not realize that you\
can actually use this loophole for some\
of the closed accounts that you\
currently have right now So before\
anybody gets all you know their panties\
in a bunch because I know some of you\
like to post your little comments about\
how this what I'm about to share with\
you might not be legal I already cleared\
this with my attorney in Beverly Hills\
who handles all my credit stuff for me\
and for my students and clients just\
like you And so I had asked him "Is this\
legal?" And he told me "Yes." So let me\
explain to you how you can use this\
medical loophole to have accounts that\
are currently closed collections\
accounts etc that are currently on your\
credit report right now that might not\
look like by face value that they are\
medically related How you can actually\
utilize this little known loophole to be\
able to get these things permanently\
removed off your personal credit reports\
Now first of all if you're not sure what\
an adverse account is it's basically\
something that's negatively impacting\
your personal credit right So you\
probably have a lot of closed accounts\
charge off accounts that you'd prefer\
that they didn't exist at all And so\
ideally you can have them permanently\
removed as if they never existed That's\
the goal especially if it's a negative\
account You don't want that on your\
credit report right So the faster you\
get it removed the higher your FICO will\
go and the more creditw worthy you will\
look if you can get these off your\
credit So you're probably thinking "Well\
Monica I don't have any medical bills or\
any of the medical bills I did have\
they're gone now." Or maybe you do have\
medical bills and you didn't know about\
this little loophole and there might be\
a hospital bill on there or an ambulance\
bill or anything related to some kind of\
care health care could even be a dentist\
bill I mean technically and I asked my\
attorney about this and he said yes\
dentistry especially when it comes to\
dentistry that's critical for your\
health that actually can fall under the\
health care category because if you\
think about it you know if you have some\
critical issue that you need some kind\
of oral surgery for for example that's\
considered a medical bill So maybe you\
didn't think about how some of these\
other things that are not technically\
directly medical related can get removed\
off your credit because by law they're\
not supposed to be on your credit\
anymore anyway So yes if you do have\
hospital bills or anything that's\
medical related that's currently on your\
credit reports you can simply send a\
letter to Experian Equifax and\
TransUnion which are three are three\
credit reporting bureaus send a letter\
one letter to each of them telling them\
to remove these hospital bills ambulance\
bills anything related to any medical\
have them removed off your personal\
credit and you could just simply say\
that this is the law and you cite the\
law And so if you want a my free credit\
templates my free credit letter\
templates you can go down below and I\
will also in the description box below\
tell you exactly what the cited case law\
is so that you can add that to your\
letter to give it a little bit more ump\
if you know what I mean So you can do\
that automatically with your medical\
bills In fact there should not be any\
more medical bills on your credit But a\
lot of things slip through the cracks\
folks You can't expect these credit\
reporting bureaus to want to do right by\
you because they're never going to do\
right by you You need to do right by\
yourself And so you need to double check\
to make sure that there's nothing\
medical related on your reports your\
credit reports because if there is it\
needs to be taken off And you don't even\
have to offer an explanation other than\
you need to take it off because this is\
the law and here's the law And that's it\
You don't need to include that it's not\
yours it's not the right amount you know\
they need to investigate None of that\
crap You just basically say "Take it off\
You're legally not able to put it on\
there so take it off." Period Now here's\
the little loophole I want to share with\
you So starting March this little\
rule about having medical stuff kind of\
really got really bolstered up and it's\
now at I guess you could say max\
capacity as far as how the law works And\
so a couple two three years ago when it\
first started to come into I guess\
general knowledge for consumers to be\
able to take off medical bills and\
anything medical related off their\
credit reports Now the full thrust of\
the entire law is now in effect as of\
March So what does this mean Well\
basically means that anything that falls\
under the umbrella of medical can be\
removed like I mentioned before It could\
literally be chiropractor bills It could\
literally be oral care bills or oral\
dentistry bills It could be anything\
that can be even construed remotely\
construed as medical It could even be\
prescription medications Now hear me out\
What if this is a this is a question I\
have for you I don't have an answer for\
you personally but what if you had a\
Capital One bill that maybe is a closed\
account or a charge off right now and\
you used to have like a credit credit\
you know Capital One account or any\
other credit card bill and you used even\
part of that to pay for anything medical\
related Like for example maybe you used\
your Capital One credit card to pay for\
some dentistry work Maybe you use that\
Capital One credit card to pay for some\
kind of medical stuff including\
prescription medication maybe some kind\
of afterare maybe some kind of therapy\
Um maybe maybe you had you know you used\
it for somebody else in your family\
Maybe a family member needed some kind\
of medical care and you had to use your\
credit card to be able to pay for it And\
so here's the loophole And again I I did\
I did ask my attorney about this so\
don't be playing armchair attorney with\
me in your comment section because\
unless you are an actual attorney you\
know my attorney did clear this with me\
and stated that yes if you have say for\
example a charged off Capital One credit\
card and you had paid medical expenses\
with that credit card that's technically\
considered a medical bill even though\
it's showing up as Capital One And that\
can go for several other accounts that\
you have on your credit report that are\
closed charge off accounts Now let me\
back up for a second because some of you\
are like "Well Monica I still have a\
Capital One card but they're late pays\
and this and that." Let's just be clear\
I know somebody's going to ask me in the\
comments and and not listen to what I'm\
saying in the video but if it's an open\
account or a current revolving account\
do not attempt to utilize this strategy\
for an open or current account that\
maybe you have late pays for Don't do\
that because it's not going to work We\
are only focusing in on closed accounts\
including charge off accounts including\
collection accounts That's it So closed\
debt as a door enable debt as a doorork\
knob closed like you are not trying to\
do this with open revolving accounts or\
late pay accounts or anything like that\
So what you need to do is go on your\
credit reports uh by going to I like to\
go to experian.com pay the $get all\
three credit reports all three credit\
you know FICO scores just to see where\
I'm at because that's the starting point\
of all of your credit repairs You have\
to get those three credit reports Now if\
you want to go to Credit Karma or some\
other place to get them for free great\
Good on you Go for it Um if you want to\
actually go to Experian Equifax and\
TransUnion you get a free report every\
single year You have to write in for it\
or if you are denied credit they have to\
by law give you a credit report for free\
But they don't usually give you the FICO\
score when you do it that way But you\
want to be able to see what your before\
and after picture is which is why I tell\
everybody go to experian.com pay the\
$get all three credit reports and\
then when you start the process of\
fixing your credit at least you know\
where your before and after points are\
going to be what your goals are etc So\
you take a look and in the very first\
section of your credit report when you\
print them out I like to print\
everything out Uh so you'll get the\
downloadable PDF file you print it out\
on a printer take a highlighter marker\
and go ahead and go through all the\
adverse accounts and see where you stand\
and what you need to get off Now you\
want to target the the accounts that are\
closed You don't again want to deal with\
any accounts that are still open and\
revolving closed accounts only and that\
includes charge offs and collection\
accounts through a credit you know a\
credit collection agency And so you want\
to see if there's anything that could be\
remotely related to medical And if it's\
a credit card then yes it very well\
might be related to medical It could you\
could have very well paid for a variety\
of different things related under the\
medical umbrella including but not\
limited to medical care dentistry or\
oral surgery care afterare when it came\
to medical chiropractic bills any kind\
of therapeutic bills any kind of\
prescription medications anything having\
to do with medical with another person\
that's all considered medical All right\
under the law And so what you can do is\
use this the same loophole and you can\
actually fight the credit reporting\
bureaus which are again Equifax\
TransUnion and Experian and you can\
actually say well these bills here this\
Capital One card this Bank of America\
credit card um you know this other\
credit card all of these are also\
related to medical bills as well because\
you know I use these credit cards to pay\
for medical bills and initially they're\
going to be like well wait a minute\
you're going to to show proof or just\
like well it happened years ago I I\
don't have the receipts anymore They're\
likely not going to ask about that\
because they're just so inundated right\
now with just tons and tons of inquiries\
and disputes and all kinds of stuff\
right now And so you can very well say\
you know I I paid expenses with this\
with this Capital One card So under the\
law as per this you know and again I\
will cite exactly what you're supposed\
to say down below in the description box\
You basically just copy and paste that\
law and that cited case law there and\
you basically tell them you need to\
remove this as per the law federal law\
and you know they might come back and\
say well you know I don't believe that\
this Capital One card was medical or\
they might just take it off altogether\
So you have a /shot that's just a\
reality Now if they don't take it off\
they might just say well no we don't\
believe that it is You just keep running\
the dispute over and over and over again\
So every days you'll be able to send\
the same letter I would do it three\
times in a row days apart until they\
remove it off or until you have to take\
it to the next level Now what is the\
next level What happens after the three\
disputes and say for example maybe one\
or two accounts fell off but the rest of\
them didn't like what happens at that\
point Then you have to start the process\
of actually doing complaints This is the\
part that a lot of people get lazy about\
but this is the part that actually is\
when the rubber rubber meets the road\
literally where you could basically say\
well you know I I need to actually start\
filing complaints against you And so\
what ends up happening is that you file\
complaints against Experian against\
Equifax and against TransUnion the three\
reporting bureaus And you basically file\
complaints with their state attorney\
generals each of them And then you have\
to file a complaint with I I'll explain\
all of this as far as down in the\
description box exactly where you're\
supposed to file the complaint online\
with the federal government And so what\
ends up happening is they start getting\
all of these letters from these\
different legal you know departments And\
then eventually what ends up happening\
is that the stuff starts to fall off\
your credit So you have to follow\
through with the final step You know it\
just irritates me when I do videos like\
this and I try to share with you some\
some pretty incredible tips and\
strategies that you'll never find from\
anybody else as far as how to fix your\
credit and somebody inevitably in the\
comments is like "Well I tried this once\
and it didn't work." Okay Well it took\
you years and years to screw up your\
credit right Years and years of you not\
paying your bills but yet you expect to\
do this in like minutes It's not how\
life works Sorry You know it's like\
working out It's like you know you let\
your body go flabby for several years\
and you don't get on the treadmill once\
for five minutes and think that you know\
you're going to turn into some\
bodybuilder or something It's not how it\
works You have to be very proactive with\
it You have to be on a schedule This is\
why I always tell people to have an\
Excel spreadsheet so that you can know\
exactly what you're doing when you're\
sending letters to who and about what\
and when you're sending complaints out\
when you're filing complaints online\
with the federal government all the\
different things that you're doing to\
follow through to be proactive Because I\
will tell you there will be a vast\
difference between how your credit looks\
today versus how it's going to look six\
months from now and how it's going to\
look months from now if you're very\
proactive and timely with how you\
actually file everything and send all\
your letters out and do your complaints\
Okay And of course at the very end if\
you still can't get anything off your\
credit I mean I can guarantee you things\
will fall off You're not going to have a\
% success rate So again don't be\
typing in the description or the in the\
comments down below "Oh Monica I tried\
this and half my accounts came off and\
the other ones won't come off." Again\
this is a process Rome was not built in\
a day as we all know And this does take\
some time but at least you got half the\
stuff off which should have made your\
FICO score go up Now we just have to\
target the other half and just keep\
focusing and pushing and paying\
attention And so what ends up happening\
after say six months and you still can't\
get those last really hard nagging\
negative things off your credit Then\
you'll have to up the ante and file a\
lawsuit And I'm going to be talking\
about that in another video So make sure\
that you give me a thumbs up helps me\
out a lot as well as subscribe because I\
have a lot of new stuff coming up as far\
as how to get things off of your credit\
credit personally but most importantly\
how to rebuild your credit how to get\
unsecured corporate or business credit\
even if you have currently a poor uh\
personal credit score and how to\
actually get cash for starting a\
business investing in real estate maybe\
investing in the market whatever it is\
that you want to do as a cash flowing\
enterprise as an entrepreneur because\
let's face it economy is not going to\
get any better and you're going to have\
to start some kind of side hustle to be\
able to make a lot of money in the\
months and years to come based on the\
the crap show that we're dealing with\
right now\'a0\
How to Use Trump's Credit Meltdown to Your Advantage\
believe it or not right now Trump is\
actually burning down what I call the\
credit house by trying to get rid of all\
the consumer finance laws that protect\
the little guy like you and me so I'm\
here to share with you exactly how you\
can circumvent all of these different\
changes in the consumer finance laws how\
you can protect yourself and how you can\
actually get on top of the credit game\
by following a couple of very simple\
strategies so let's get into it\
[Music]\
so we have something called the Consumer\
Finance Protection Bureau the CFPB and\
what that is there for is it was\
developed in after the crash of\
to protect people like you and me\
from unscrupulous creditors and lenders\
and so forth and also give us reprieve\
to be able to file complaints that will\
actually get investigated and so the\
problem is Trump is actually gutting\
this organization to the point where\
when you file complaints online against\
your creditors and your collection\
agencies and the credit bureaus like\
Experian and Equifax and TransUnion\
you're going to find nowadays that your\
complaint is going to end up exactly\
nowhere and so that's really unfortunate\
because this bureau was put into place\
to help protect people to be able to\
help investigate unscrupulous creditors\
people that are violating the law people\
that are calling you late at night and\
they're not supposed to be people that\
continue to call you even though maybe\
you've sent them in writing a cease and\
desist which by the way if you are ever\
having problems with creditors or\
collection agencies calling you at all\
hours of the day and night or calling\
your work you could send them in writing\
a cease and desist notice that basically\
says from this point forward you are not\
to contact me in any form or fashion\
whatsoever so by stating that you can\
actually get them to stop and by law by\
federal law they do have to stop\
contacting you except the problem is\
without the the bureau in place to help\
protect you and to file complaints\
against these unscrupulous creditors and\
collection agencies which let's face it\
most of them are unscrupulous right you\
don't have any barrier to help protect\
you from all of this illegal activity\
that's going on and so many of you might\
have filed complaints based on some of\
the prior videos that I talked about as\
far as going to\
consumerfinance.gov which is down in the\
description box below filing a cla\
complaint against your creditors and\
your collection agencies and the credit\
bureaus like Experian Equifax and\
TransUnion for not doing an adequate\
investigation about the disputes that\
you're filing against these these\
organizations except before they would\
actually do an investigation when you\
filed a complaint on consumerfinance.gov\
of and now they don't because there's\
nobody working there trump actually\
gutted the entire bureau and so the next\
step which hasn't happened yet so I do\
have people that constantly comment in\
my comment section below and they'll\
state stuff like "Well Trump reversed\
this and that." Well it actually didn't\
happen yet when you actually have\
federal laws in place they have to be\
overturned and they have not been\
overturned yet so this is the first step\
and I guess you could say burning down\
the credit house as far as Trump is\
concerned the next step is probably\
going to be reversing everything that\
works in your favor as the consumer as\
the little guy and the little gal in\
this equation and that's going to\
probably happen down the road hopefully\
by then you'll have followed all of the\
strategies that I teach as far as fixing\
your credit and you won't really have to\
worry about these consumer finance laws\
because you'll have fixed your credit by\
then in fact that's what I always tell\
people it's like strike when the iron is\
hot right now you can actually use a lot\
of these federal laws in your favor\
because they have not been reversed yet\
don't just sit on your hands and oh well\
it's it's too late now well it's not too\
late now you can still do all the\
strategies that that I teach in my\
videos but let's talk about this one him\
burning down this bureau and what it\
actually means for you so to to make a\
long story short what you want to do is\
you want to file complaints against\
every and all creditor a collection\
agency and the three credit reporting\
bureaus that are not removing the debt\
that you're asking them to remove based\
on them doing a faulty investigation so\
when you file a dispute with Experian\
Equifax and TransUnion using one of the\
many strategies I teach in my other\
videos and they do their -day\
investigation and it basically just\
updates it meaning it doesn't go\
anywhere and it just basically updates\
it in the creditor's favor and not your\
favor essentially I can guarantee you\
they did not do an investigation okay\
they're just leaving it on there because\
they're lazy they don't want to take it\
off and they know that you the little\
guy and the little gal in this equation\
you don't know whether or not they did\
an investigation they don't usually do\
investigations and they basically just\
leave it on there and I guess it's up to\
you to figure it out and you'll just\
hopefully go away at some point well the\
thing is you don't want to be that\
person that goes away it irritates me to\
no end when people make comments in my\
videos below my videos and they say\
stuff like "Well I tried the dispute\
process once and it didn't come off."\
It's like "Okay so if you go to the gym\
one time for minutes are you gonna\
get jacked up and never have to work out\
again?" And the answer is no that's not\
how life works sorry it just doesn't\
work that way or if you eat one really\
clean meal and and then eat donuts for\
the rest of your life that one clean\
meal is supposed to take take you know\
take you far to the end of your lifetime\
i don't think so the same with credit\
you have to keep chiseling away at you\
have to keep doing your disputes you\
have to keep filing your complaints you\
have to keep going at your creditors\
collection agencies and the credit\
bureaus over and over and over again i\
have a rule it's every days so when\
you file a dispute with the credit say\
the credit bureau say you file a a\
dispute letter with Experian Equifax and\
TransUnion and then once you wait the \
days you should be doing another dispute\
right after that you need to start\
stacking up those disputes and\
eventually they'll get sick of you\
because most people fall off they're\
lazy they're distracted they're they'd\
rather just do something more\
entertaining like watch a Netflix show\
and they're not really that interested\
in their financial future and\
recapturing their creditworthiness which\
is everything as you know in this world\
i mean you can't rent an apartment you\
can't buy a house you can't buy a decent\
car you can't get any credit cards at\
decent interest rates and in some cases\
you can't get a decent job if your\
credit doesn't pan out the way it should\
when they run your credit report so you\
need credit to survive okay so I have\
some people that are like oh you know\
I'm going to live off the grid well okay\
well good luck with that but most of us\
are not living off the grid let's just\
be real here and then I have other\
people that criticize those that can't\
pay their bills like why are you doing\
all of these credit repair strategies\
Monica when they're just dead beats and\
they don't deserve any of these\
strategies well guess what what happens\
if you have a medical emergency you are\
half dead in a in a ditch someplace\
because somebody ran you off the road\
you go into the hospital you're three\
months in a coma you come out and you're\
hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt\
well are you a deadbeat should I tell\
you to just go pay your bills then i\
mean things happen to people that Hello\
that's just welcome to life okay my job\
is to help you get on the winning end of\
the credit game and so what I tell\
people to do is do your disputes over\
and over and over again but here's where\
the rubber meets the road or at least it\
used to before Trump started to burn\
down the credit house when it came to\
destroying this bureau that helps\
protect consumers like you and me and so\
what it used to do is help you navigate\
so you file a complaint with\
consumerfinance.gov which is the\
government agency that's supposed to\
investigate whether or not the creditors\
collection agencies and credit bureaus\
are doing their investigations like\
they're supposed to and they're\
reporting like they're supposed to\
because they're supposed to be abiding\
by federal law many times they do not\
they are the most scandalous people on\
the planet and consumer finance was\
supposed to help with this process of of\
being the barrier between you and them\
the unscrupulous characters out there\
who are in in it for the money obviously\
right now they're gone they don't help\
you anymore there's like one guy running\
the show and everybody else is gone it's\
like literally a shell of a bureau and\
everything's been stripped out so what\
do you do how do you file your your\
complaints like after you do your\
investigations and your disputes with\
the credit reporting bureaus and\
nothing's happening and they're not\
protecting your rights as a consumer\
what do you do because you can't go to\
consumerfinance.gov gov to file a\
complaint anymore because there's nobody\
there to help you anymore it's been\
completely gutted okay so there might be\
a form letter that goes out who knows\
but I think the creditors collection\
agencies and credit bureaus know damn\
well that there's nobody behind the\
wheel anymore and they feel like they\
have free reign to screw you over as\
they did before when the bureau was\
put into place to help consumers like\
you and me so you could still file your\
complaint with consumerfinance.gov gov\
which again is below down in the\
description box but do not expect\
anything to happen file anyway who knows\
maybe it'll be you know some life will\
be blown into it at some point i doubt\
it but you could still file your\
complaint anyway but you need to do it a\
different way because the way that\
you're going to gain traction in getting\
some of this crap off your credit things\
that are working against you negatives\
and this also includes uh inquiries as\
well maybe you're having a hard time\
getting inquiries off and you need them\
to get off immediately if you're going\
to be creditw worthy because as you know\
each inquiry will cost you at least two\
FICO points and on top of that it\
doesn't fall off your credit for at\
least two years so you can do this\
strategy with all of that with people\
that have had inquiries people that have\
negative accounts on your credit people\
that have late pays on open revolving\
accounts foreclosures a bankruptcy u\
maybe you have a repossession you can\
use this strategy for all of the above\
now please note that yes you will still\
file your complete with\
consumerfinance.gov but it's probably\
going to go nowhere but hey it's a hail\
Mary at this point you might as well\
just throw it in throw your hat in the\
ring just to see what happens because\
it's seconds online to do it it's %\
online but here's where you're really\
going to get into it you're going to\
have to start filing complaints in the\
state in which all your creditors and\
collection agencies and credit bureaus\
exist so you're going to be filing with\
the attorney general in each one of\
those states so you're going to be\
filing with the attorney general in\
Pennsylvania against TransUnion you're\
going to be filing against the against\
uh Experian in I'm sorry Equifax in\
Georgia with the attorney general in\
Georgia and you're going to be filing\
against Experian with the attorney\
general in Texas you're going to be\
filing letters complaint letters some of\
them are going to be physical some of\
them are going to be online and it\
depends on how the state accepts these\
complaints and you're basically going to\
say that Experian Equifax TransUnion or\
whatever one you're filing a complaint\
against is not adequately investigating\
certain files certain credit files and\
you list the credit files say there's\
five of them you list five of them they\
are not as per federal law doing a\
proper investigation on these five\
accounts okay and they're probably going\
to be all lates or they're probably\
going to be all like closed charge off\
accounts whatever they are or maybe\
there's accounts you just list them\
all in the letter so one letter will go\
to the attorney general in Texas for\
Experian one letter will go to the\
attorney general in Pennsylvania for\
TransUnion and one letter will go to the\
attorney general in Georgia for Equifax\
and then you do the same thing for your\
individual creditors so say one\
creditor's in New York so you're going\
to file an attorney general complaint in\
the state of New York against whatever\
XYZ creditor or collection agency it's\
going to take time to do this the good\
news is many of these are available\
these complaint systems are available\
online so you do have to check it out to\
see if it's available in that state but\
you do have to file it in the state in\
which the credit or collection agency or\
credit bureau is and you should file as\
many complaints as you possibly can the\
next step is to file with the Better\
Business Bureau in those areas so Better\
Business Bureaus are not statewide\
they're actually regionally run so\
you're going to have to do a little bit\
of research to figure out where the\
Better Business Bureau is for each\
specific region of each specific bureau\
or collection agency or creditor you\
want to file against but you're going to\
file it regionally against them in each\
Better Business Bureau region and again\
you're going to have to do some research\
so for example if one of your creditors\
is located in New York New York then\
you're going to go ahead and say uh\
Google file a complaint against um a\
creditor or file a business complaint in\
New York New York uh with the Better\
Business Bureau and they'll tell you\
exactly what the regional Better\
Business Bureau complaint link is and\
the good news is with the Better\
Business Bureau it's % online you're\
not going to be mailing any letters in\
anywhere to file complaints against\
these companies on because it's going to\
be all online % with Better Business\
Bureau so again you're going to be\
filing a complaint with\
consumerfinance.gov which again don't\
expect anything to happen with that but\
you might as well do it anyway because\
then you can keep track a track record\
because sometimes the attorney general\
in in a specific state will ask you "Hey\
did you file a complaint with\
consumerfinance.gov?" You need to be\
able to say yes because believe it or\
not they do have a lot of complaints\
when it comes to credit issues and you\
might actually have to say "Yes I did\
file with consumerfinance.gov i did file\
with the federal government you need to\
be able to say yes okay so that means\
that you do have to file with consumerf\
finance.gov even though it's not going\
to go anywhere okay I'm here to tell you\
it's not so you're like thinking okay\
well Monica what's supposed to happen\
with all of these complaints well what\
ends up happening is that the attorney\
generals in each one of these states\
will send a letter to each of the\
creditors that you're indicating each of\
the collection agencies you're\
indicating and each of the credit\
bureaus that you're indicating saying\
"Hey what's going on we have Joe Blow\
from whatever state you're in\
complaining stating that you're not\
doing a proper investigation so we need\
to know what's going on with this and so\
when they're barged it's not just going\
to be one complaint that they're barged\
with they're going to be barged with a\
ton of complaints from these different\
um\
agencies and then they're going to be\
like "Damn this is we can't just sweep\
this under the carpet you can't just say\
we did an investigation and didn't do\
anything and hope the guy or the the\
chick\
disappears this person's serious and not\
only are they serious they kind of know\
what they're doing and and what to do\
with the process u most people don't\
know how to do this process which is why\
these credit bureaus are able to get\
away with doing an investigation and not\
doing a damn thing for you and so that's\
what they do % of the time so like I\
said it it irritates me to no end when\
people try to do their credit repair\
process they do one dispute and they're\
like "Oh Monica you know it didn't work\
so this is this doesn't work." Trust me\
it took me about months plus to get\
just one judgment off my credit report\
but I just kept at it i kept at it kept\
at it and it was worthwhile to me so you\
can't expect this this to be a\
oneanddone deal it's not i even had one\
of the YouTube viewers I couldn't\
believe that he actually complained\
about this because it's like he sent a\
bunch of envelopes to different\
creditors and collection agencies using\
the strategy that I have in one of my\
other videos and he was complaining\
because he only had four of his many\
debts removed of course he didn't tell\
me how many of the debts he actually had\
sounded to me like the dude was a total\
deadbe because he sounded like maybe he\
had different debts that were late\
charge offs judgments etc but he was\
complaining that only four came off\
hello that's how it starts it's going to\
start with a handful of accounts and\
then you keep going at it keep going at\
it keep going at it with all of these\
different strategies including more\
disputes more envelopes to the creditors\
and collection agencies that have\
require a signature more disputes to the\
credit bureaus which is Experian Equifax\
and TransUnion and more complaints yes\
you can file complaints over and over\
and over again i would I wouldn't do\
them all in a row otherwise you're going\
to seem like a psycho but you want to do\
a complaint maybe to the attorney\
general in each of the states that I\
mentioned for the credit bureaus which\
is Texas Georgia and Pennsylvania and\
then maybe wait days and do another\
complaint and another complaint like\
every days you're doing complaints\
with these attorney generals in these\
states against the credit bureaus which\
again are Experian Equifax and\
TransUnion in addition to that keep\
filing complaints against every single\
one of your creditors and collection\
agencies in their appropriate state as\
well so you'd file against those\
individuals or those individual\
companies in their state where there are\
they are located as well as their\
regional Better Business Bureau in all\
of those areas as well and then they're\
getting flooded with complaints they\
don't want to deal with the squeaky\
wheel it's just not worth it to them\
okay this is how stuff starts to fall\
off so while you're doing all of these\
complaints on a very scheduled routine\
basis not a oneanddone deal folks okay\
like I say all the time it took you\
years to screw up your credit it's not\
going to take you five minutes and\
overnight to fix it it's just not going\
to happen that way you do have to be\
very very religious about the process\
consistent and be willing to do it over\
and over again while you're constantly\
doing these complaints you're also\
constantly every days filing a new\
physical letter comp um dispute letter\
going to Experian Equifax and TransUnion\
you do this every days so you keep\
filing those disputes and I always tell\
everybody I don't like doing online\
disputes they are not effective doing a\
physical letter i don't care how many\
times people argue with me i have proof\
that the letter always gets more stuff\
off because people argue well Monica you\
know there's really no everything's a\
computer and a computer really you think\
a computer is opening up your dispute\
letter a computer is there's now a robot\
guy who's opening up your letters and\
actually either typing them in or\
scanning them in as they come in there's\
a physical human being that's part of\
that process and that's why I have this\
one particular strategy in one of my\
other videos about doing a handwritten\
letter and that will be a much more\
effective you don't actually have to\
handw write it out watch the video to\
check out how I do it but you do a\
handwritten letter and sometimes a human\
being actually has to get involved in\
the process because the computer itself\
cannot scan some of those handwriting\
fonts okay so you do need to be aware\
that you have to constantly be chiseling\
chiseling chiseling chiseling okay did\
you get that chiseling you're constantly\
going to be filing disputes every \
days with the three major uh bureaus\
Experian Equifax TransUnion you're\
constantly going to be doing complaints\
with the major attorney generals of\
Experian Equifax TransUnion in Texas\
Georgia and Trans and in Pennsylvania\
and you're going to be doing that every\
days you're also going to be filing\
Better Business Bureau complaints every\
days in the regions where all of your\
bureaus are as well as your collection\
agencies and creditors and don't forget\
to file complaints against your\
creditors and collection agencies with\
their attorney generals in their states\
as well and you keep doing this over and\
over again again this is not a\
oneanddone deal this doesn't happen\
overnight it doesn't happen in five\
minutes you have to keep working at it\
and I can guarantee you that if you do\
this over and over again within six\
months maybe eight months you'll have\
relatively pretty damn close to perfect\
credit but you have to be willing to put\
the time into it all right you just do\
have to do the time you have to do the\
time and if it's not worth it to you\
stop watching these videos go watch TV\
because I can tell you right now in \
months from now you're still going to be\
eight months older than you are now and\
you might as well have good credit\
instead of sitting on your ass and doing\
nothing because I can guarantee you that\
in eight months from now if you do\
nothing you're going to be thinking back\
I wish I would have started eight months\
ago because now I'd have really close to\
perfect credit right so you can make a\
decision and do something about it or\
not so be sure to watch a lot of my\
other videos because I go through the\
strategies on exactly how the dispute\
process works if you found that this\
content was valuable to you please give\
me a thumbs up it helps me out a lot as\
far as well as subscribe to my channel i\
have a lot more stuff coming especially\
when it comes to fixing your credit as\
well as doing ultimate side hustle\
opportunities because we all have to\
make more money if we don't want to get\
into this predicament to begin with with\
credit \
TRUMP\'92S NEW LAW Just Crashed Credit Scores for Millions in !\
We have breaking news. There are going\
to be major changes coming to credit\
scores and credit reporting in \
that's going to affect everyone.\
On today's video, we're going to cover\
three major topics on major changes that\
are coming to credit reports and credit\
scores that you do not want to miss.\
Now, we're going to start at number\
three and work our way down to number\
one, which you do not miss. But I also\
have two bonuses in there because\
there's a lot to cover as so many\
changes are happening very fast. But\
before we get into this video, make sure\
that you smash that like and subscribe\
button so this video gets out to more\
people so everyone can stay informed\
about these major changes that are going\
to be happening fast. So let's go ahead\
and jump right in because we have a lot\
of ground to cover today. Now, let's put\
number three up on the screen right now.\
By now, pay later loans will soon hit\
credit scores and experts think Gen Z\
could be at risk. I mean, it's not just\
Gen Z. It's everybody. It's literally\
everywhere you turn. You can buy\
something at Walmart and put it on buy\
now pay later. You could buy a flight\
and do a buy now pay later, which I\
recently saw. And you can also buy\
concert tickets with it now. I mean,\
literally, you could buy food with it.\
You can use Door Dash now and different\
food apps to order food or your\
groceries with buy now pay later apps.\
And listen, the first thing people think\
is, "Well, it's great. It's going to\
help build my credit." Uh, no, not so\
fast. So, go and pump your brakes real\
quick and let me truly break it down for\
you because a lot of people don't\
understand how this can truly destroy\
your credit score. Now, let's put the\
chart up on the screen that says\
breaking down your credit score cuz I\
really want to break this down so you\
can have a real full understanding of\
how this truly affects your credit score\
because nobody's really explained it to\
you. Now, understand, I have credit\
cards so you don't have to. Now, this is\
not a good thing. This is nothing to\
brag about because I don't need all\
those credit cards, okay? It's not\
necessary, but I get them to test them\
to see exactly how the banks are, how\
they react, how they give you credit\
limit increases, so I can come back and\
give you the information. And I'm over\
an credit score. We could put my\
score up on the screen right here so you\
can see that. That's how I know what I'm\
doing. I know how to manage my entire\
credit profile. But one thing that\
nobody talks about, everyone wants you\
to get a credit card. They want you to\
get this new line of credit. They want\
you to do this. But understanding\
something, every time you add a new line\
of credit to your credit profile, it\
lowers your average age of credit. Let's\
target this section here. Credit age is\
points and it only makes up % of\
your credit score. But here's the big\
butt. The more you add to it, the more\
it hurts your credit score. And you need\
the account to have length open. That\
means the account has to stay open for a\
significant amount of time for you to\
actually pull age of credit out of it\
and payment history as it's shown on the\
chart. Payment history is one of the\
most valuable things because it's % of\
your credit score. So, the more payments\
you have and the longer the account is\
open, the more positive impact it has on\
your credit profile. I know that's a\
lot, but I just I just had to tell you\
that. Here's the problem with buy now\
pay laterers. They only usually run \
months or months. There's some of\
them that run all the way up to and\
months. Now, those are decent. The\
ones that go all the way to months,\
not so bad. Because remember what I just\
said here. You want the positive payment\
history to build up your credit profile\
and stay open as long as possible.\
That's why an old credit card that's\
been open for years is very valuable\
because it's building up all of that\
positive payment history and it's\
keeping your age of credit long. But say\
for instance, you go and you get a buy\
now pay later for a plane ticket, then\
one for some groceries, then another one\
for some clothes, and then another one\
for something else. You see what I'm\
saying here? Like you just added all\
these small different lines of credit to\
your credit profile, lowering your\
average age of credit. You want your\
average age of credit to grow past \
years. If it keeps staying below one\
year, because every time you add it, it\
reduces it. Every time you reduce your\
average age of credit, you are deemed a\
high risk borrower, which means you're\
going to have a lower credit score, and\
we don't want that. So, I want everyone\
to understand these are very\
detrimental. They can really hurt your\
credit, and you need to buckle down\
because now they're going to start\
showing on your credit reports starting\
in the fall of This article really\
broke it down and told us exactly what's\
going to happen and how they really\
don't know what they're talking about.\
Because even reading the article really\
pissed me off that somebody wrote this\
article and has no clue what they're\
talking about with credit. Like, oh,\
it's going to be beneficial for your\
credit. No, it's not. Stop talking about\
things you don't understand and\
miseducating people out there about this\
because, of course, it's most likely\
someone that is being paid by the\
lenders to make you think this is\
beneficial to your credit profile, and\
it's not. Always remember, your accounts\
need to age. The longer they stay open,\
the better. Because when you open up a\
buy now pay later, if it only stays open\
months or months and then it\
closes, it has a negative impact on your\
credit profile. So, the moral of the\
story with buy now pay laters is stay\
away from them because they're going to\
start destroying credit profiles.\
They're going to do more harm than help.\
Now, moving on to bonus one of the two\
bonuses we're going to talk about on\
today's video. Crypto is pushing into\
the finance/credit\
sector. you are going to have the\
ability to use your crypto as an asset\
to purchase a home moving forward. Now,\
let's put the article up on the screen\
so we can read this sector. At the end\
of June, the US Federal Housing Finance\
Agency issued a new directive\
instructing both Fanny May and Freddy\
Mack to count Bitcoin as an asset on\
single family home mortgage\
applications. Now, previously, mortgage\
applicants had to convert any Bitcoin\
holdings into US dollars if they wanted\
their crypto to count. Now, it doesn't\
just stop there because crypto has\
already pushed into the credit card\
world with the Gemini card. Now, this\
isn't a plug for them. The Gemini card,\
I already have this. Instead of getting\
points and miles, you get crypto. Now,\
American Express is also doing a\
co-branded card with Coinbase that is\
set to release in the fall. And we'll\
cover that more, but this is a huge,\
huge sign that America is truly trying\
to turn into the crypto capital of the\
world. Now, moving on to number two,\
which is one of the biggest one of all,\
and I've been a huge proponent of this\
for years. Now, today on July th, when\
I actually shot this video, is when PT\
made this massive announcement on his\
Twitter account/x, whatever you want to\
call, people are actually still on this.\
Like, why are they making announcements\
on here? Like, why don't you do a real\
press release with a lot of real\
information? Because they're just\
disseminating it and they're actually\
coming up with ideas as they're moving\
along, which is just wild. But this is\
still a huge deal. Don't let me take\
away from that. So, PT, who is PT? Pt is\
the actual director of the US Federal\
Housing Finance Agency. He announced,\
"My order, thanks to my boss, POTUS,\
will allow for Americans to use their\
rent to qualify for a mortgage. Credit\
history will no longer just include\
credit cards and loans. This is huge."\
Which he's right, it is huge. This\
should have been happening decades ago.\
As much as you pay in rent, that should\
go towards you trying to qualify to\
purchase a home. If you've been able to\
maintain those rental payments on time,\
why would you not be able to qualify for\
a home? But here's the part that I don't\
understand is how they're going to\
integrate this because this is a huge\
massive story. Americans can now use\
rent payments to qualify for a mortgage,\
the FHFA says. So they have to include\
this in Vantage scoring and in FICO\
scoring. Now FICO is privately owned and\
so is Vantage. So they're going to have\
to kind of muscle their way into that to\
force them to do that. So then when they\
pull your credit report for mortgage\
lending, they can actually see it on\
your credit reports. Because previously\
there was no actual listing on a credit\
report for how it reports. It shows up\
as an actual miscellaneous on your\
credit reports, which is not normal. It\
should just come up as some type of\
lending product. But again, rent isn't a\
lending product. So, as more moves on\
about this, I will continue to cover\
this story and bring you more\
information to give you more details on\
how this is going to break down so we\
can see how people will truly qualify\
with their rent reporting, helping them\
get access to buying their own home. I\
want to give a special shout out to all\
my beasters out there that are working\
hard to fix their credit using dispute\
beast, the most advanced AI credit\
repair software ever created that comes\
with a % money back guarantee. But\
specifically to Kennet, Kennet's credit\
score went up points after just one\
round with Dispute Beast. And Arthur,\
Arthur's credit score went up points\
after just two rounds with Dispute\
Beast. But let's not forget Destiny.\
Destiny's credit score went up \
points after just one round with Dispute\
Beast. Dispute Beast link is going to be\
in the video description and pinned at\
the top of the comments for anyone that\
needs to fix their credit. Now, moving\
on to bonus number one. Let's put it up\
on the screen. The Trump administration\
silently employs Palunteer to gather\
personal data of each American. Yes, you\
heard that right. You're like, "But what\
do they need all that information for?"\
To build a social credit score. Think of\
it like this. Everything you do and say\
and how you react on social media is\
being tracked and stored into a\
database. So, if you talk crazy on\
social media, it could affect your\
actual career or trying to get another\
job, which is already currently being\
used, but a lot of people don't talk\
about it. You could be potentially\
flagged as a high-risk borrower to\
lenders based on your social media\
activity. But it doesn't just stop there\
because I mean, everyone's like, "Well,\
maybe I'm not on social media. I don't\
care." Also, think about this. They can\
get access to your bank accounts and see\
what you're spending money on. And if\
they choose to, they can cut you off\
whenever they want. You know, there was\
this big hoopla about Doge getting\
access to social security information,\
to Medicare information. Why do they\
want all this information? So they can\
put it into one massive database and\
track everything you're doing. Literally\
giving the government massive databases,\
including bank details, student debt,\
medical claims, medical debt, disability\
status. They could literally see\
everything that's going on in your life\
and stop you at any point in time they\
want. or just create that social credit\
score to give it to other lenders, other\
institutions, other career\
opportunities, and just stop you dead in\
your tracks. A social credit score is\
definitely on the way. And like I just\
said, employers are already using this\
to track future possible employees to\
see what their activity is, what they're\
actually watching on social media, what\
they're commenting on, how they're\
reacting to other people. Employers want\
to see this. This is valuable data to\
see if you're going to be a reliable\
employee and better yet a better\
candidate to get potential lending\
options.\
Last part's the most important. Now,\
moving on to the biggest story of all.\
Let's put it up on the screen here.\
Number one, the CFPB reverses position\
on removing medical debt from credit\
reports. Yeah, we talked about this\
moving it into like January and then\
February and then March as a new rule\
came into play that would remove all\
medical debt from credit reports\
permanently and then this happened. Now,\
let's scroll down to the middle of this\
story where it says, "In a motion filed\
at the end of last month, the CFPB\
joined the Consumer Data Industry\
Association and the Cornerstone Credit\
Union League to request a judgment\
holding unlawful and vacating the\
medical debt rule because it exceeds the\
bureau's statutory authority." Now,\
you're probably asking yourself, who's\
the Consumer Data Industry Association,\
right? So, now let's put it up on the\
screen so you can see exactly who the\
Consumer Data Industry Association is.\
We're going to scroll down a little bit.\
that you're going to see right here. The\
Consumer Data Industry Association is\
the voice of the consumer reporting\
industry, representing consumer\
reporting agencies, including the\
nationwide credit bureaus, regional and\
specialized credit bureaus, background\
check companies, and others. Basically,\
it's made up of all of the actual CEOs\
of all of these credit reporting\
agencies. They are in the best interest\
of the CDIA. Now, the CDIA made what's\
called Metrocompliance reporting. The\
entire way that every single lender is\
supposed to actually report everything\
on your credit report is structured in\
Metro And the CDIA actually helped\
create it with the help of other\
lenders. They all work together to\
manipulate the entire system in their\
benefit. So, it's in the best of their\
interest to help push this lawsuit\
forward with that credit union\
association also to try to get all of\
this medical debt back on credit reports\
to continue to allow Americans to drown\
in debt so they can drop your credit\
scores. So, all of these lending\
institutions can benefit more because\
then you're a subprime borrower. Once\
you're a subprime borrower, then guess\
what? They can charge you higher\
interest rates. Now, I'm going to put\
the link in the video description for\
the litigation tracker so everyone can\
see exactly what's going on with this\
case. As of right now, it is still\
waiting on a decision from the judge in\
the district court of Texas Eastern. So,\
this is a long process. I'm guessing\
that by the end of this month of July or\
towards the middle of July is when we\
are going to get a decision on what is\
going to happen. And I'll be honest with\
you, this has never ended well for any\
situations for consumers of any cases\
that will help consumers in the Texas\
court systems because the Texas court\
systems were the ones that actually\
blocked the Biden rule to stop late fees\
and junk fees on credit cards. That's\
where the whole thing went arry and the\
Texas judges went against the Biden\
administration and basically shut it\
down. So now you still have late fees\
and junk fees on credit cards. Now what\
does this mean for people's credit\
reports that have medical debts? It\
means that there's a huge chance, more\
than % chance that all that medical\
debt is going to come back on people's\
credit reports and just destroy\
Americans credit scores with medical\
debt that was previously removed. Now\
it's going to come back and hurt you\
again. Now, if you are someone that had\
medical debt removed from your credit\
reports because of the new rule going\
into play, but then all of a sudden it\
pop back on your credit reports, let us\
know in the comments because we want to\
keep everyone aware of these massive\
changes and who has actually been\
affected because we have seen medical\
debt pop back up on people's credit\
reports that was once previously deleted\
by the credit reporting agencies. So,\
it's not a good sign. And the biggest\
thing to understand is don't panic. You\
can fix the situation. You can dispute\
the hell out of it because it has to be\
accurate, complete, and fair. Now, a lot\
of people say, "Well, what do I do when\
the letter comes back and they say it's\
been verified?" Verified means nothing.\
Understand that is an automated response\
to keep you down and be like, "Oh my\
god, I'm done. I have nothing else to\
do." No, you can dispute it again. You\
can dispute it as many times as you\
want. Now, generally speaking, it takes\
four to six rounds to get something off\
the credit report. That's just the\
warm-up phase. Some people can get it\
off between one to four rounds, but\
everyone's going to vary depending on\
the item and how it's reporting. And\
people always ask me the question, but\
what if it's reporting properly? I'm\
going to tell you right now, there's not\
one single account on your credit report\
that's reporting % properly. Because\
none of these companies abide by the\
Metro compliance reporting standard.\
Because what you see on a credit report\
is completely different from what I see\
on a credit report when I'm looking at\
Metro compliance reporting. There's\
missing data entries. There's missing\
dates. There's all kinds of missing data\
inside of your actual credit reporting\
system that they don't want to admit to.\
but we expose it using Metro \
compliance reporting. That's how we\
destroy these items and get them off of\
credit reports. It is % possible. I'm\
telling you, I've been doing it for over\
years now. So, hope you enjoyed this\
video. We covered another big one on the\
massive changes that are coming to\
credit reports and credit scores in \
so you always stay ready.\
Fastest Way to INCREASE Your Business Credit Score! Funding Hack!\
This is the fastest way to grow your\
business credit score.\
Did you know that not building your\
business credit from day one could cost\
you $\
or more in funding over the next few\
years? In today's video, I'm going to\
show you the fastest way to build your\
business credit and unlock over a\
quarter of a million dollars in funding\
step by step. This is the same strategy\
I used to secure over $for my\
business. Without this, Dispute Beast\
wouldn't even exist today. I wouldn't\
have had the money to grow and scale.\
And here's the crazier part. Most\
business owners never even start\
building their business credit properly,\
and they wonder why lenders keep saying\
no. So, make sure that you stick with me\
through the entire video because if you\
miss even one of these steps, you'll\
leave thousands of dollars on the table.\
But let's start with the biggest\
question. Why does business credit even\
matter? Well, most people think, uh,\
I'll just use my personal credit for\
now. But that's a huge mistake. Because\
here's what happens when you don't build\
with business credit. You get denied by\
banks because your business has no\
credit history. You'll have to max out\
personal credit cards, which tanks your\
personal FICO score, or you'll pay\
higher interest fees. And worst of all,\
when you finally do need funding to\
grow, you won't qualify. And that's\
exactly why you need to build your\
business credit from the very first day\
you open your business checking account.\
Business credit is what lenders look at\
to decide whether your company is\
trustworthy. And the sooner you start,\
the better your chances of unlocking\
high limit cards, lines of credit, and\
those massive loans that you're looking\
for. Let me tell you my story real\
quick. When I started my business, I\
signed up for my free Dun's number,\
which is your free Dun and Brad Street\
number. And there is where I found\
something very interesting. It's called\
the credit builder service. They help me\
open my business credit file and start\
reporting trade lines to build my payex\
score. Now, a lot of people are going to\
argue on the internet, oh, a payex score\
doesn't matter. Well, in some instances,\
it does not. But the information that\
you're building with Dun and Bradreet is\
very valuable. And that's exactly why I\
started with Dun and Bradre. And then a\
little while later is when I opened up\
my Nav account and that's when things\
really took off. Both Dunn and Bradstre\
and Nav have been my go-to business\
credit partners for over years now.\
Through their platforms and their Nav\
Prime membership, I was able to monitor\
all of my business credit scores, report\
trade lines every single month, and\
secure funding offers I never knew I\
even qualified for. Honestly, thanks to\
NAV and Dun and Bradreet working\
together, I grew my business credit\
score and ended up with over $\
in funding. And today, I'm going to walk\
you through exactly how to use both of\
these tools to grow your credit even\
faster. So, I'm going to break this\
video down into five very important\
steps that you do not want to miss. If\
you miss any of these, again, you're\
leaving thousands of dollars on the\
table. But, I want to say something\
before I jump into this list. If you're\
someone out there that's building your\
credit using different types of trade\
lines like Granger and Uline, there's\
nothing wrong with that. It's just going\
to take you longer. I want to be really\
clear on that because a lot of people\
will ask me, "Are these trash? Are they\
not?" No, they're going to help you\
build business credit, but\
unfortunately, those take way too long.\
So, let's jump into step number one.\
Open your business checking account.\
This is so crucial. Step one is very\
obvious, but you'd be surprised how many\
people skip it. Open your business\
checking account and do not mix business\
and personal money. And here's another\
reason why I recommend opening it\
through NAV. They offer a checking\
account with zero fees. It integrates\
with your NAV dashboard and it positions\
you for better offers down the line.\
Now, you can open your Nav checking\
account right now through the link below\
in the video description and it sets the\
foundation for everything else. And also\
be aware, there is nothing wrong with\
having multiple different types of\
business checking accounts. In fact, I\
recommend that you have anywhere from\
three to five business checking accounts\
to handle different types of your money.\
And this is why I also recommend Blue\
Vine because it's going to give you cash\
back for any time that you're using your\
business debit card. Link is going to be\
in the description for all of these\
things that we talk about today in case\
you need them. Now, moving on to step\
number two, which is set up your Nav\
Prime. Next, you're going to sign up for\
Nav Prime membership. Here's why Nav\
Prime is so powerful. Every month, your\
subscription fee is reported to the\
business credit bureaus as a trade line\
automatically. You get full visibility\
into all your business credit scores\
done in Brad Street, Experian business,\
Equifax business, all in one dashboard.\
You also unlock funding offers you might\
not have seen anywhere else tailored to\
your specific profile. If you want to\
see all of your credit scores, if you\
were to do this individually, you would\
have to pay for Experian business,\
Equifax business, done in Bradreet\
business, all of those completely\
separate. Here you get them all for the\
same low price, which I absolutely love\
because I learned this the hard way. I\
went and actually bought all of them and\
I'm like, "Yo, this is so expensive just\
to see my business credit scores." So,\
if you're serious about building\
business credit, Nav Prime is\
non-negotiable. It gives you that\
consistent trade line reporting month\
after month. You can sign up through my\
link in the video description to get\
started today. I want to give a special\
shout out to all my Beasters out there\
that are working hard to fix their\
credit using Dispute Beast, the most\
advanced AI credit repair software ever\
created that comes with a % money\
back guarantee. but specifically to\
Brandon. Brandon's credit score went up\
points after just one round with\
Dispute Beast. And Ashley, Ashley's\
credit score went up points after\
just two rounds with Dispute Beast. But\
let's not forget about Julio. Julio's\
credit score went up points after\
just one round with Dispute Beast.\
Dispute Beast link is going to be pinned\
at the very top of the comments and in\
the video description for anyone that\
needs to fix their credit. Now, moving\
on to step number three. The Nav Prime\
card. Here's where it gets even better.\
Nav launched the Nav Prime card and it's\
a gamecher. This single card reports two\
trade lines every month. One to your\
business credit and one to your personal\
credit. It's a revolving trade line\
which helps your utilization and your\
overall credit profile. And just like\
the membership, it integrates seamlessly\
into your NAV dashboard. When you\
combine the Nav Prime membership with\
the Nav Prime card, you're stacking\
multiple trade lines and building\
history fast. This is why I always\
recommend applying for this card as soon\
as you sign up for Nav Prime. And\
there's no hard inquiry to see if you're\
qualified for it. Step number four, set\
up your Dun and Bradreet credit builder.\
Now, we talked about the Dun and\
Bradreet number. That's % free, but\
the Dun and Bradreet credit builder\
account is completely different. It is\
not free. So next you'll want to set up\
your Dun and Brashre credit builder\
account. And here's why. Done and Bradre\
is the original business credit bureau.\
They assign your business its Payex\
score. Lenders, vendors, even government\
contracts use Dun and Brad Street scores\
to assess your business. Their paid\
credit builder service lets you report\
your own trade lines, which is a huge\
boost early on. And this is exactly how\
I boosted my credit score for my\
business even faster. Dun and Brad\
Street has been helping me manage my\
business credit profile for over years\
now and pairing them with NAV\
accelerated my growth more than anything\
else I tried. So, let me break down the\
credit builder as quickly as I possibly\
can. Now, the credit builder is not\
free. It's either on a monthly basis or\
a contract for a one full year that you\
can cancel after that, but you have to\
sign up for a minimum of a -month\
contract. So, if you're going to do\
this, make sure that you're prepared and\
you have the proper trade lines and you\
have a strategy on how to use this so\
you don't waste your money. So, let's\
say you purchase something from me,\
another business owner, for bucks,\
whatever it may be. Now, you\
have the ability to report that to the\
credit builder service as a transaction.\
Now, all you're going to need is the\
actual receipt, the phone number, the\
contact information of the business that\
you actually purchased something as a\
business, and you report that to the\
credit builder. Now, credit builder Dun\
and Bradreet will actually go back to\
that other company and see if it's\
actually true and factual and then they\
will report that trade line. So, listen,\
I got a little out of control with this\
because you I think it's like you can\
report up to or depending on which\
tier you choose. So, I tried to get as\
many as I could in. I reached out to\
everybody that I'd worked with, any\
contractors, anybody that I'd exchanged\
actual money for their services with my\
business. I said, "Hey, listen. Can I\
please report you to my credit builder\
service? So with Dun and Brady so I can\
build my business credit score.\
Everyone's like, "Yeah, sure." They\
verified the information and then Dun\
and Brady reported it and\
instantaneously like I saw my business\
credit score shoot up over like and\
points in the first days and then\
days the moment it started reporting.\
And then of course Nav Prime kicked in\
almost exactly at the same time because\
I tried to time it perfectly where it\
could affect my business credit score\
within that to day window. And\
within days of me doing this, my\
credit score shot to the moon for my\
business credit. And I was just like\
shocked. I was like, "It does work."\
It's true. I didn't have to get any gas\
cards. I didn't have to do any Uline,\
any Granger. And I'll be honest with\
you, I tried to start with I think it\
was Uline or Granger. And the process\
was like so long for me to get set up,\
then for them to give me a line of\
credit, then for me to purchase. I was\
like, "Yo, this is way too much." And I\
started doing the research. That's how I\
got to this point. I started doing as\
much research on the different types of\
tools that I could use to build my\
business credit and that's what led me\
to the Dun and Brad Street Credit\
Builder and then NAV and here we are\
with over $in funding within\
that first year.\
Last part's the most important but\
moving on to step number five. Stay\
consistent and scale. Here's the most\
important part. Consistency. Building\
business credit is not a oneanddone\
thing. These are the four things that\
you need to focus on. Pay everything on\
time. Keep your utilization low. Monitor\
your scores monthly in NAV and keep\
adding positive trade lines over time\
because your contract with Dun and Brady\
is going to be a month contract. Use\
it as much as you possibly can for that\
first year and then you could be done.\
Remember, every single transaction with\
your business is an opportunity to\
report a trade line. If you do this\
every month, you'll see your limits go\
up, your approvals come easier, and your\
business credit profile grows stronger.\
And before you know it, you'll have\
access to maybe even\
more. But what if you don't start today?\
Let me paint the picture for you. You're\
denied for funding when you desperately\
need it. You max out personal cards and\
hurt your personal credit. And I'm going\
to tell you right now, it's the biggest\
mistake I see all the time. People are\
heavily in debt on their personal cards,\
destroying their personal credit, and we\
don't want that. You pay ridiculous\
interest rates, if you qualify at all,\
and you watch your competitors pass you\
by because they took the time to build\
their business credit properly. Don't\
let that be your story. Start building\
now because the best time to plant a\
tree was years ago. The second best\
time is today. So, let's do a quick\
recap. Here's what you need to do right\
now. Open your business checking account\
with NAV. Sign up for Nav Prime\
membership. You can also set up an\
account with BlueVine to get you started\
with that. Apply for your Nav Prime card\
and set up your Dun and Bradstreet\
credit builder. Now, all the links are\
going to be in the video description\
below. So, go take action now. So, I\
hope you enjoyed this video. We covered\
another big one on how to build your\
business credit score faster.\
How to Open a Business Bank Account the RIGHT Way in \
I'm going to make sure that you don't\
fall for the same traps that I did. And\
I want to teach you how to open up a\
business bank account the right way.\
Now, wait. Before you open that business\
bank account, let me show you the five\
biggest mistakes that are costing\
entrepreneurs thousands in misductions,\
frozen funds, and even IRS audits. Most\
people get this wrong. Even gurus on\
YouTube gloss over this, but not today.\
This video will save your business. So,\
let's get into it. Look, opening a\
business bank account isn't just a box\
to check. I made a lot of mistakes along\
the way. So, this is why I feel it's\
very important that I teach you how to\
not fall for any of these crazy traps\
that I fell for, to be honest with you.\
Because your business bank account is\
the financial spine of your business. If\
you mess this up, it's like building a\
million dollar house on sand. You won't\
be able to get business credit. You'll\
miss out on major tax deductions, which\
is one of the biggest parts of being a\
business owner. I'll be honest with you.\
And you'll be flagged by the IRS if your\
personal and business finances get\
tangled. This video is your blueprint.\
I'll walk you through what to do, what\
to avoid, and how to set this up for\
long-term success because that's what we\
want because long-term success equals\
massive business funding. So, I'm going\
to break this video down into five very\
important steps that you do not want to\
miss. We'll start at step number one and\
work our way to step number five. Now,\
they're not in any chronological order\
because one is more important than the\
other. Okay, so let's just jump into it.\
Step number one, choose the right bank\
Choose the Right Bank\
or honestly you'll regret it. It's very\
important to understand that not all\
banks are created equal. In you've\
got three main options. Option number\
one is traditional banks. big names like\
Chase or Bank of America. Solid\
reputation, but slow processes and tons\
of fees. They want to squeeze you for\
everything they can possibly get. Now,\
credit unions is one of my favorites,\
but it's great for relationship banking,\
but limited digital tools and limited\
funding to be honest with you. They\
don't have a lot of options. But some\
massive credit unions do, but a lot of\
them honestly don't. Listen, just\
between me and you, a lot of people like\
to tout that like Navy Federal is the\
best for business credit and business\
funding. It's really not. I don't\
understand what the hype about it is\
because they don't have very much to\
offer. Now, this is my new favorite\
sector that I've really pushed into on\
the business side, which is online banks\
like Blue Vine or NAV. Fast approval, no\
monthly fees, and instant virtual cards.\
So, you can get started in like\
literally minutes. In all honesty, Blue\
Vine is one of my number one favorites\
because it's not just a debit card. It\
allows you to get cashback rewards for\
transactions for your business, which is\
huge. And on top of that, they have a\
plethora of other products for your\
business. Business credit cards,\
business lines of credit, business\
funding. There's so many things under\
the Blue Vine umbrella that honestly I\
missed out on because I jumped on the\
bandwagon of Bank of America because\
honestly, Bank of America was the only\
one that would allow me to open up a\
business bank account because I was a\
credit repair company way back in the\
day. And another great little tidbit\
that a lot of people don't know, Blueine\
actually was able to give me PPP\
funding. So, I was able to get a free\
loan for my business during the whole\
pandemic scene, which is pretty crazy.\
And I didn't have to pay back any of it.\
and they made the process super simple.\
They got me approved and then they got\
my loan actually forgiven. Now, let's\
flash back to Bank of America. Bank of\
America got me declined and then didn't\
help me figure out why I got declined.\
And then NAV, I used NAV to build my\
business credit. That was my backbone\
for my business credit at the time. Now,\
NAV is way more super advanced than it\
ever has been. NAV also helped me secure\
close to a half a million dollar in\
funding, business funding for my\
business from to Literally a\
half a million dollars in business\
funding, all because I had my entire\
system built around Nav's credit\
building program. So, this is my pro\
tip. If you want fast approvals, easy\
integrations, and no surprises, online\
business banks like BlueVine and NAV are\
dominating the game this year. Now,\
here's the biggest mistake to avoid.\
picking your personal bank just because\
it's familiar. That's a lazy move. Look\
at the features, not the local. And\
again, I made the same mistake. I went\
with Bank of America. It's my oldest\
bank account. We'll talk about that a\
little bit later in the video, but it is\
truly one of my oldest bank accounts\
that I seriously regret. Now, step\
Must Have Documents\
number two, don't open an account\
without these documents. Before you even\
apply, here's the must-have document\
list that you need to have ready before\
you even walk into a bank or do it\
online. Number one thing is your EIN\
from the IRS, not your social security\
number. That's not an EIN. Stop\
believing these idiots to say you can\
use your social security number as the\
EIN. No, that is definitely fraud and it\
will get you hemmed up with the IRS once\
they figure it out. Now, you can hire\
someone like Rocket Lawyer to get you\
your EIN. There's a fee for it, of\
course, or you could do it online all on\
your own. But once you get that letter\
confirmation, save it, take a picture of\
it and save it in a file because a lot\
of these banks or a lot of institutions\
for lending will ask you for that EIN\
letter. Next up, you want to have your\
articles of organization or\
incorporation. Now, after that, your\
operating agreement, even if it's a\
single member LLC. Again, I use Rocket\
Lawyer me personally cuz they simplify\
the entire process. Now, that's not a\
promo plug for them, but I'm just saying\
that's the path that I chose. Now, also\
your business license if it's required\
in your state. Not every state requires\
a business license. Now, of course,\
valid ID and then your proof of address\
also, which can be some type of utility\
bill in the business's name, which I\
highly recommend, of course, that you\
have that already. Something to do very\
simple could be your internet service,\
phone service, or cell phone service in\
the business name that shows that proof\
of address because if you're missing\
even just one of these, you could be\
rejected or delayed for weeks. Now, a\
pro tip. Some banks now require\
beneficial owner disclosures due to new\
federal rules in So have that info\
ready also. Now moving on to step number\
Business Name\
three. Make sure your business name\
matches everything. I know it sounds\
simple, but this one right here, this\
messes up more new business owners than\
you think. Your business name needs to\
match the next following four items.\
Your LLC docs or whatever type of\
incorporation you have. your EIN\
paperwork, your website domain, and your\
business license if it's required per\
your state. Because if your EIN says,\
like, as an example, Mike's Auto Repair\
LLC, but your bank app says Mike Auto,\
they'll flag that. It's very, very\
important to understand that. One of the\
biggest mistakes to avoid is using a\
DBA, doing business ads, without listing\
it properly. That's a fast track to\
compliance issues and banking headaches.\
Everything must match. This is the\
number one reason why people get\
declined for business accounts because\
the address doesn't match, the name\
doesn't match, none of it matches. So,\
everything must all match completely and\
wholeheartedly. I cannot stress it\
enough to you. I see this mistake happen\
all the time. It's crazy. People are\
like, "Mike, I got declined. Why did I\
get declined?" I don't know. Ask the\
bank. And then they tell, "Oh, they said\
something's wrong with my address\
because you move the address, you change\
the address, and you didn't change it\
everywhere." I want to give a special\
shout out to all my beasters out there\
that are working hard to fix their\
credit using Dispute Beast, the most\
advanced AI credit repair software ever\
created that comes with a % money\
back guarantee. But specifically to\
Brandon, Brandon's credit score went up\
points after just one round with\
Dispute Beast. And Ashley, Ashley's\
credit score went up points after\
just two rounds with Dispute Beast. But\
let's not forget about Julio. Julio's\
credit score went up points after\
just one round with Dispute Beast.\
Dispute Beast link is going to be pinned\
at the very top of the comments and in\
the video description for anyone that\
needs to fix their credit. Now, step\
Fees\
number four when you're choosing a bank\
is avoid these sneaky fees in \
Because banks are slick, they'll\
advertise no fees and then hit you with\
the following ones, which is the next\
four of my favorite. Minimum balance\
fees, incoming wire fees, paper\
statement fees. Yes, if you want to pay\
for statement, they want to charge you\
for it and ATM fees outside of their\
network. And that's why I always\
recommend online banks that are built\
for small businesses. And as I talked\
about earlier, BlueVine, for example,\
has no monthly maintenance fees and\
gives you % APY on balances up to\
$\
That's literally free money for your\
business.\
Last part's the most important. Now,\
Business Credit\
moving on to step number five. Set up\
your business credit from day one.\
Opening the account is just the start.\
If you want business credit, funding,\
and lines of credit, do this from day\
one. I cannot stress this enough to you.\
Make sure to get your done and Brad\
Street number for free on day one from\
the beginning. And make sure that all of\
the information there matches all of\
your other information as we stated\
earlier. This is very crucial. A lot of\
people say, "Darn Brad Street doesn't\
matter." Yes, it does. It is a number\
one database for business lending just\
for them to verify your information\
matches and it's correct. And the\
biggest one that nobody talks about is\
making sure to register your business\
properly with Experian business and\
Equifax business. Also, make sure all of\
the information is accurate and\
complete. Now, if you want to get your\
business credit scores from Experian and\
Equifax, they're going to charge you and\
so will Dun and Bradshere. Done and\
brash will give you like a basic free uh\
score that they give you inside of your\
profile. But moving past all of that,\
it's going to cost you money. So, just\
be aware of that. You also want to make\
sure that you use your business account\
for every business transaction. Also,\
set up autopay for subscriptions and\
vendors. And then the other biggest one\
is maintain cash flow in and out every\
single month. And the final one, the\
most important one of all, never coingle\
personal funds. I want you to understand\
that most lenders look at your bank\
activity before they even look at your\
credit scores. So, if your account is\
dead or messy, you'll get denied.\
Period. So, make sure that you're not\
comingling and you're using your\
business account properly for everything\
all of your business needs at the end of\
the day. Also, make sure that your Knax\
code is properly. That's your NAS\
code that it's designed for your\
specific industry. Choose the right\
industry that is not a high-risk\
industry because some banks may possibly\
decline that which we see all the time.\
That's the reason why I started with\
Bank of America because all these other\
banks did not want to do any business\
with a credit repair company because I\
was a credit repair company way back in\
the day. So, I had no choice but to go\
with Bank of America. But now, we have\
companies like Blue Vine and NAV that\
don't have crazy restrictions like that.\
So, let's recap the bank account\
blueprint. Here is your fivestep\
checklist. Write this down, screenshot\
it, whatever you got to do. Number one,\
pick the right type of bank. Traditional\
versus online. I'm always going to be a\
proponent for all the online ones.\
Number two, gather all required\
documents. I keep everything in a\
massive folder that's specifically for\
my bank with all of my documents. Number\
three, match your business name across\
the board with everything. And also make\
sure that your knack code matches\
everywhere with every credit reporting\
agency and with Dun and Bradre and the\
banks everywhere. And number four, my\
favorite of all, avoid hidden fees like\
a pro. I was very fortunate that my\
business was very profitable in the very\
beginning when I got started, but I\
remember I paid a lot in bank fees. Now\
I don't pay anything cuz I only bank\
with Blue Vine. But in the past, I was\
just like, yo, how is this even legal?\
because the business side of everything\
business credit or the business sector\
is not regulated by anything. I know\
that's kind of crazy, right? And number\
five, set up your accounts for\
fundability. Making sure to do all of\
this is going to ensure that your\
business is set up to get funded\
immediately. This isn't just about\
banking. This is about unlocking access\
to credit, funding, tax strategy, and\
peace of mind. I cannot stress enough as\
a business owner, having peace of mind\
is super valuable. Now, if you found\

with them both for a really long time\
now.\
THEY GIVE YOU $K with ONLY A FICO! SSN NOT REQUIRED! ITIN IS ACCEPTED!\
\'a0I'm going to be\
sharing with you where you can get\
$for your business and you don't\
even have to have the best credit score\
So in today's video we're going to be\
reviewing Action Opportunity Fund small\
business loans that work for you They\
also support ITIN only borrowers Now\
actually an opportunity fund is one of\
the largest CDFIS So CDFI stand for\
community development financial\
institution Now CDFIs are absolute gems\
because the underwriting requirements\
are going to be much easier versus the\
big banks or even credit unions for that\
matter So they're going to have looser\
underwriting They're going to be able to\
offer extremely low interest rates\
compared to the commercial banks Now\
Loan Details\
action opportunity fund offers loan\
amounts from a minimum of all the\
way up to And this is affordable\
capital with transparent terms and no\
prepayment penalty They offer interest\
rates as low as % They can offer\
different rates that vary based on which\
repayment plan you prefer Now what makes\
Axion Opportunity Fund different so\
they're here to support you and provide\
you with resources your business needs\
to thrive They are a nonprofit lender So\
because they don't exist to make profit\
they use the money from your repayment\
to support other business owners They\
offer customized loans and repayment\
terms because no two businesses are\
alike Now as I mentioned the great thing\
about CDFIS is that they don't really\
look at your credit score right so\
you're more than just a number So they\
look at more than just your credit score\
to determine your business viability So\
the first step is you can apply online\
And the great thing is that you can get\
a quote without impacting your credit\
score The second step is to review your\
offer And step three is to finalize your\
loan So once you've chosen an offer\
they'll ask for final documentation to\
verify They'll review and come back to\
you with a final offer and a loan\
agreement And upon signing the loan\
agreement you'll get the money you need\
for your business in your bank account\
In addition to loans they also provide\
personalized business coaching mentoring\
and a comprehensive business resource\
library where you can find all the\
information you need Now to get started\
and get a quote for a loan you just\
click this button right here get started\
and it'll open up the application All\
right So at the top has a summary of the\
business and the details as well as the\
financing So how much you actually\
earned in So the business revenue\
and then right here it says please note\
that by clicking the submit loan\
application you are consenting to allow\
action opportunity fund to conduct a\
soft pull of your credit in order to\
provide you with offers This means that\
a request to review your offers will not\
affect your credit\
Loan Options\
score All right so it says just one\
moment All right so it says you've been\
pre-qualify for the loan options\
Congratulations All right so right here\
they give three different loan options\
for\
$So these are just slightly\
different terms Now as you can see with\
the shorter term there's a interest rate\
of With the months it's \
And with the -month it's There\
is a\
% origination fee so just keep that\
in mind Now right down here pretty much\
just breaks down the loan details Now\
right here it says not satisfied with\
these options You can contact one of the\
loan officers to get more information on\
your options All right so let's just\
walk through some of these different\
loan options So the total loan amount is\
And so this is going to be\
monthly payments of\
$The interest rate is\
$% There is a % origination fee\
So the total repayment after it's all\
said and done So this is going to be\
paid back after one full year So the\
total repayment is going to be\
$So again how they have this\
sort of laid out So again the shorter\
term is going to have the lowest overall\
cost So you are going to have a high\
monthly payment as it says right here\
But in terms of total interest that\
you're paying is going to be the lowest\
overall cost And then when you're\
looking at the -month term this is\
going to be the lowest monthly payment\
However since you do hold the loan for\
longer you will be subject to more\
interest and actually the interest rates\
increase from to So again\
this is the same $loan except\
this is out to years or months\
versus months And the monthly payment\
is going to be much lower Again same\
origination fee no prepayment penalty\
The total repayment is going to be\
$So again actually an opportunity\
Conclusion\
fund is a community development\
financial institution They're also a\
c nonprofit lender Now the trade-off\
with using CDFIS and nonprofit lenders\
is that of course you're going to have\
lower underwriting requirements So even\
if you don't have the best credit score\
even if your income isn't the highest\
you can still qualify Because of that\
the process usually tends to be a little\
bit more drawn out and they are usually\
going to require additional\
documentation So this isn't like an\
instant approval type of situation Now\
in comparison let's say you were go to a\
major bank or even some credit unions\
Usually the underwriting criteria is\
going to be higher especially in today's\
current economic times where even a lot\
of credit unions are now asking for tax\
returns and requiring you to have over a\
credit score Now with action\
opportunity fund you have a credit score\
as low as a Overall I think CDFI's\
community development financial\
institutions are one of the most\
underutilized financial resources\
There's literally thousands of CDFIs\
across the country Now if anyone is\
interested in researching a CDFI in\
their local area I've dropped the CDFI\
locator link in the description of the\
video Also Axion Opportunity Fund is\
available in states so you can check\
their website to make sure that your\
state is one of the eligible states\
before you submit a pre-qualification\
You CAN Legally ERASE All Collections! Watch this Now!\
This is the number one credit repair\
mistake that people make when dealing\
with hoax debt collectors.\
If you've got a collection account on\
your credit report, don't pay a dime\
until you watch this. They don't want\
you to know this. The credit bureaus,\
the collection companies, the shady\
third-party debt buyers, they're praying\
you never see this video. Because if you\
knew the truth about collections, you'd\
never pay them the way they want. You'd\
never fear them the way they expect. And\
you could flip the script entirely,\
legally wiping debts off your credit\
report, even if you owed it. This video\
could be the difference between a \
and a between paying $in\
interest or paying nothing. So sit tight\
because in the next minutes, I'm\
giving you the truth they hide in the\
fine print. Here's why this is one of\
the most important videos you'll ever\
watch. % of your credit score is based\
on payment history and collections hit\
that hard. Even paid collections can\
destroy your credit score. You're judged\
by lenders, landlords, even employers,\
all based on the same exact data. Fixing\
this isn't just about credit. It's about\
freedom. It all starts with\
understanding how collections really\
work. I'm going to break this down into\
five truths that you do not want to\
miss. And then right after that, I'm\
going to teach you exactly how to remove\
those collections the right way. So,\
let's not waste any more time and let's\
Most collections are not verified\
jump into truth number one. Most\
collections are not verified. Here's the\
first truth they hope you never\
discover. Most collections on your\
credit report are not legally verified.\
Debt collectors buy your info for\
pennies on the dollar, then report it to\
the bureaus with zero documentation. I\
mean, think about it. Isn't that kind of\
crazy? But under the Fair Credit\
Reporting Act, they are required to\
prove it. But in most cases, they can't.\
That means you can legally dispute it\
and delete them. Not hide them, not\
negotiate them, erase them. Now, moving\
Paying collections the wrong way can drop your credit score\
on to truth number two. Paying\
collections the wrong way can drop your\
credit score. This next part is going to\
truly blow your mind, and I don't think\
that enough people talk about it because\
paying a collection the wrong way can\
actually lower your credit score. And\
you're probably saying, "But why? I'm\
paying the debt." Because once you pay\
it, it updates the collection to paid,\
but keeps it on the credit report for \
years. Lenders still see it. Algorithms\
still punish it. But here's the kicker.\
If you disputed it properly and had\
removed it, it'd be like it never\
existed. That's the real power. Removal\
is greater than a payment. Because\
listen, I'm never going to tell you,\
"Oh, don't pay your debts. You don't\
have to pay those debts." No, that's not\
what I'm saying here. You have to\
understand something very clearly. If\
you pay it and it's not deleted, it's\
still hurting your credit score because\
it still has the status of collection or\
charge off. Paying it does not help your\
credit score in any way, shape, or form.\
You have to delete it. Moving on to\
Challenge the legitimacy of collections\
truth number three. You can challenge\
the legitimacy of the debt. Every\
collection must be backed by paperwork\
that proves the next three things. They\
own the debt. You owe the exact amount.\
They're legally allowed to collect it.\
If they can't do all that, you can fire\
off a debt validation letter under the\
FDCPA, which is the Fair Debt\
Collector's Practices Act. And this\
forces them to prove it. And here's the\
truth. Most of them can't. They'll fold.\
They'll delete it. They'd rather walk\
away than get sued for violations. But\
here's the thing. You don't want to send\
some old outdated debt validation letter\
from the one that's been\
circulating all over every social media\
platform. You want to request the\
purchase agreement signed by all parties\
involved. Now, let's put this letter up\
on the screen. I showed it in another\
video because it's very powerful and a\
lot of people don't understand because\
you keep asking for something that\
doesn't exist. A lot of people say,\
"Show me a wet signature. I want to see\
the original contract with the wet\
signature." Again, you're asking for\
something that doesn't exist. But pay\
attention to what this letter says. I\
notice you are attempting to collect the\
listed alleged debt. I hereby dispute\
the validity of the alleged debt listed\
below entirely. I also request\
verification of the alleged debt,\
specifically a copy of the original\
purchase agreement. Agreement must be\
with the original creditor and signed by\
all parties involved. I am requesting\
this because I have had different\
companies reach out to me about the same\
alleged debt. That whole paragraph is\
very powerful and people never use this\
to their advantage. And the second part\
is even more powerful. I'm requesting\
immediate deletion of all prior\
reporting made to any consumer reporting\
agency, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion,\
and Anovvice. You must cease collection\
efforts until the alleged debt is\
validated. You must show proof that you\
legally own this alleged debt and that\
it is accurate and complete and then\
sincerely you put your name, your date\
of birth if you want to, your mailing\
address. You can just put your mailing\
address and listen, it doesn't matter if\
you sign it. I don't give a damn what\
all these amateurs on social media\
saying they're going to take your\
signature and they're going to transfer\
it over to It's not true. Okay? Those\
are amateurs that don't do credit repair\
saying that. We've never seen that done.\
Okay? And I'm not saying it's not\
possible, but I'm just telling you, I've\
been doing this now for years, and\
we've never seen that nonsense. You can\
sign it or you can just print it.\
Whatever you choose, it doesn't matter.\
It's not that serious. Now, moving on to\
You might not owe it anymore\
truth number four. You might not even\
owe it anymore. Yes, you heard that.\
Because this is another thing they pray\
you never learn. Debts expire. Every\
state has a statute of limitation,\
usually to years, where they can no\
longer sue you after the statute of\
limitations has expired. Literally, they\
can still call, they can still send\
letters, still report it, but legally,\
they can't do a thing in court once time\
is up. This is what we call a timebar\
debt. Don't restart the clock by making\
a payment or admitting to the debt.\
Silence is strategy. And you can\
literally go on Google and type in\
statute of limitations for debt in\
California, statute of limitations for\
debt in Georgia, and it will come up and\
tell you what the statute of limitations\
is per your state. So you can know if\
this debt is time barred and you can no\
longer be sued. And before you come into\
the questions and you ask me, well, when\
does the debt clock start? The debt\
clock starts days after your first\
missed payment that caused you to become\
delinquent. That's what's called the\
first date of delinquency. You can only\
find that on your credit report at\
annualcreditreport.com,\
which is % free if you want to pull\
your credit reports there. I want to\
give a special shout out to all my\
beasters out there that are working hard\
to fix their credit using disputebeast,\
the most advanced AI credit repair\
software ever created that comes with a\
% money back guarantee. But\
specifically to Louise, Luis's credit\
score went up points after just one\
round with Dispute Beast and Jensie.\
Jensen's credit score went up points\
after just one round with Dispute Beast.\
But let's not forget James. James'\
credit score went up points after\
just one round with Dispute Bees.\
Dispute Bee's link is going to be in the\
video description and pinned at the top\
of the comments for anyone that needs to\
fix their credit. Now, moving on to\
You have rights\
truth number five. You have rights they\
won't tell you about. Of course, they\
won't tell you about them. Debt\
collectors love playing dirty. Always\
remember this one golden rule. Debt\
collectors lie % of the time. Debt\
collectors love playing dirty. Harassing\
calls, threats, embarrassment. But guess\
what? Under the FTCPA, they cannot do\
the following things: call you before\
a.m. or after p.m. Harass or\
threaten you. Talk to your boss or\
family about the alleged debt. Lie about\
what you owe. If they do any of this,\
you can sue them and win $or more\
in damages per violation. Your rights\
are power, but only if you know them.\
And understand something. If you're\
going to sue them, I would highly\
suggest that you sue them in small\
claims court because going through the\
legal process with an attorney is very\
lengthy and very exhausting. And a lot\
of these attorneys don't really like to\
fight against debt collectors. Just\
keeping it with you. And at the end\
of the day, all of these consumer law\
attorneys all talk a big game. At the\
end of the day, they don't really want\
to go up against debt collectors because\
it's a lot of paperwork and it cost them\
a lot of money. Unless they know they\
have a solid case with % proof, you\
ain't got nothing. I'm going to be\
honest with you. Okay? So, understand\
it. That's why it's important if you\
have the proof, sue them in small claims\
court. Save yourself the headache of\
even dealing with an attorney when you\
can do it on your own. Now, for the most\
important part, how to remove the\
collections the right way. There are\
going to be five very important steps in\
this part right here. So, here's how you\
do it the right way. Step number one,\
you're going to pull all three credit\
reports from Experian, Equifax, and\
TransUnion. They're all % free from\
annualcreditreport.com.\
But also, don't forget to pull the\
secondary credit reporting agencies\
also. And you can also get those reports\
for free from Lexus, Nexus, LCI,\
Anovvice, ARS, Credco, Clarity, Data X,\
Microbuilt, and Factor Trust. You need\
to attack it everywhere. Do not freeze\
the secondary credit reporting agencies\
because then you're going to leave them\
there and then when they delete it from\
the big three credit reporting agencies,\
it's going to pop back on your credit\
report. That's why things come back\
after they're deleted because you did\
not eradicate it everywhere. So\
remember, there's no point in freezing\
them. You must attack the secondary\
credit reporting agencies. If you don't\
do that, you're wasting your time.\
Number two, we're going to send a debt\
validation letter to the collection\
company. Very simple. I gave you the\
letter earlier. But you're also going to\
dispute the collection with the credit\
bureaus, every single one of them. And\
you're going to send the exact same debt\
validation letter to the credit bureaus.\
I know a lot of people say, "What?" Yes.\
send that exact same letter to the\
credit bureaus. And number four, if no\
response in days, demand removal. And\
number five, report violations to the\
CFPB. The CFPB only has employees\
currently working there, but they are\
still in fact working. So, you can file\
a complaint. Now, remember, you have to\
dispute first because a CFPB is a\
complaint center. It's not a disputing\
platform. Once you've disputed, then you\
upload your complaint into the CFPB\
system with your proof of the letters\
that you sent and the response that you\
got from the credit bureaus, the\
collection companies, whoever it may be,\
and they didn't actually give you proof.\
Last part's the most important. Now, the\
big question is, but what happens, Mike,\
if they send me proof? They're not going\
to send you proof. I've been doing this\
for a long time, and I've never seen\
them send a purchase agreement. Because\
when the debt is purchased, it's\
purchased all together in one big debt\
ball. It's thousands, possibly hundreds\
of people's different debts. And by law,\
they cannot show you the other debts of\
other people under the FDCPA. And yes,\
this is a lot of work. I get it. So, if\
you want it done faster and handled for\
you, you can use Dispute Beast, the most\
advanced AI credit repair software ever\
created that comes with a % money\
back guarantee. And it's % mobile\
friendly, meaning you can literally fix\
your credit from your phone with no need\
for a computer or a printer. And before\
you ask me, yes, Dispute Beast attacks\
all of the credit reporting agencies,\
all of them that we just talked\
about. And it also attacks the creditors\
also. Link is going to be in the video\
description and pinned at the top of the\
comments for anyone that needs to use\
Dispute Beast to fix their credit. I'm\
going to leave you with this last\
thought. I want you to understand\
something. They are banking on your\
ignorance. The less you know, the more\
you pay. This is the moment to flip\
power back into your hands. \
whatever works best for you\
How\uc0\u8198  \u8198  to Boost Your Paydex Business Credit Score in Days\
we're going to be diving in in the show on how to build an\
excellent business credit score an actually payex score in less than days now before we jump in let me first\
tell you that I am not associated with dun and Brad street I don't work with dun and Brad street I don't work with\
dun and Brad street credibility so I like to get at that out there whenever I'm talking about done Brad street\
Experian Equifax I just like to let you know that I'm not directly a associated with the reporting agencies um I want to\
clarify that before I jump in and kind of decode this but I will be discussing\
with you today exactly how dun and Brad Street's payex score works I'm actually going to be talking about business\
credit scoring in general business credit building and talking to you about exactly how you can build an excellent\
business credit score or a payex score with dun and Brad street um in less than two months and as a matter of fact this\
isn't just applicable done in Brad street although we'll be talking about how the payex Works breaking that down\
how this is possible in reality you can actually do exactly what I'm talking about following the exact same steps to\
also build an excellent business credit score with Experian commercial and Equifax commercial with the steps that\
I'm going to outline today so thank you very much for joining us I promise you I will make the most use of your time um\
let me introduce myself before we jump in and get too far my name is Ty crle I'm actually the CEO of credit suite and\
at credit Suite we help people build business credit we actually help companies get get business credit we\
also help them get financing to start Build and Grow um we've helped thousands and thousands and thousands of clients\
build their business credit so if you know anything about credit Suite anything about me you'll know I have a\
pretty good reputation out there for knowing what I'm talking about when it comes to business credit building I\
won't be talking to you about you know a big sales pitch today today is just really mostly about getting you very\
good quality information on exactly the steps to execute to get this done if you want more information when we're done\
about building business credit feel free to check out our website we've got a free guide credits.com\
that's credit suit.com you can get a great free guide on kind\
of mapping out the four steps that you could actually take to build business credit that'll expand off of what I'm\
actually talking about today so before we dive in first of all let's talk about dun and Brad street now as I said in the\
beginning a reminder I don't work for dun and Brad street I'm not directly affiliated with with dun and Brad street um I just want to disclose that before I\
kind of dive in and tell you a little bit more about who they are so if you're not familiar with dun and Brad street and before I get too far in let me also\
mention that you might notice I have a tendency to talk kind of fast for one that's how my brain just processes\
information and for two um I get very excited when I talk talk about topics\
like building business credit and when I get excited I have a tendency to talk a little bit fast so I'll try to slow\
myself down but be patient with me the good news is is that I'm going to get you a lot of information in a short\
period of time if you can keep up here so dun and brid street is the biggest and major business credit reporting\
agency they were actually created back in okay they were created well before the first Consumer Credit\
Reporting Agency ever showed up on the scene so this is interesting because a lot of people tend to think that\
business credit is new they tend to think that business credit building is in its infancy but the reality is is\
that the business reporting agencies led by dun and Brad street have been allow have around decades before Consumer\
Credit even existed as a matter of fact there's been five US presidents that have actually worked for done in Brad\
street in their history when they were the mertile company um before they actually merged become dun in Brad\
street so they actually hold the largest supply of worldwide business information with over million records on file\
now it's interesting to know that they do handle records worldwide and if you wanted to get a comparison Experian\
commercials the next biggest reporting a you see they have about a hundred million records on files so nowhere\
close to where dun and bride street is so the DMB payex score is the main business credit score used in the\
Dun & Bradstreet's Paydex Score\
business World okay it's known as the payex score and it's provided by dun and Brad stre you've probably heard this\
before where somebody might say to you I have an payex score what that simply means is it means they have a good score\
with the best known most well-known most popular business credit reporting agency\
that exists which is DMB so from dmbb quote the DMB payex score is d&b's\
unique dollar weighted numerical indicator of how a firm paid its bills\
over the past year based on trade experiences reported to DMB by various\
vendors I'm G to go to the next slide but I might come back here because I just want to see okay so I am gonna break that down I wanted to make sure\
that I didn't need to break it down on that slide so in their own definition dollar weighted means that D&B gives\
more weight to accounts with higher limits than ones with lower limits so what this means is it means if you have\
two accounts on your business credit report one is a revolving credit card with a $limit one is a revolving\
credit card with a $limit it means that it weighs the $limit\
into the score heavier than it does the Thousand credit limit now why that's important is if you're ever going to\
have to go late on an account you always want to go late on the accounts with the lowest limits because that will do the\
least amount of damage when you go late and have a late reported on a higher limit account it will do more damage to\
your score because they wait those higher limit accounts higher into the score calculation than they do lower\
limit accounts now another part of their definition is how a firm paid its bills over the past year this means a score is\
based on past performance as the main driver now I've got other um videos you\
can check out on our YouTube channel which is youtube.com creditsuite you can see there that we go through and we break\
down how d&b's credit scores work they have two different types of scores they have predictive scores that try to\
predict people's risk based on a lot of other different information demographic information firmographic information\
public records Etc then they have what are known as performance credit scores\
which are strictly based on the information they have internal on past\
performance so this is important to you because they're not trying to predict your risk based on all the information\
from these outside sources instead what they're doing is are giving a score based on your past performance with\
information they already have so that means the key here is that you want to make sure that you have reports with DMB\
that you are actually paying your bills as agreed because if you have accounts with DNB and pay your bills as agreed\
that's what they're basing the actual payex score on so it's simply based on\
how you pay your bills and this is what's great about the payex score actually this is what's beautiful about\
business credit you see in the consumer Credit World scores are based on all these complicated factors but in the\
business credit World the Main score is based the payex score is based on how you pay your bills so all you have to do\
to get a good score is pay your bills on time and if you do that on accounts that report to D&B then that's what will\
actually get you a positive credit score so the payex score like all other business credit scores is for a business\
Business Credit Scores\
and it's in the business name so this is based on basically the business itself's\
ability to pay pay their its actual bills not you as the business owner so with business credit the business builds\
its own credit profile and score and sometimes this is confusing to a lot of people as a matter of fact when we run\
ads on places like Facebook it's interesting because I'll have all kinds of crazy comments of people that say\
well this is a scam this isn't legitimate but it is very legitimate just as your social security number has\
a credit report linked to you as an individual your business has its own credit profile and score that's linked\
to its EIN number so that's what business credit scores are that's what they're based on it's based on your\
business's ability to pay not you as a consumer or not you as the business owner so what happens is once you\
establish this initial business credit profile and score through trade lines which I'll show you how to do that then\
the business starts qualifying for greater and greater amounts of credit so consumer credits much the same you start\
with no credit you get some items that report to the consumer reporting agencies you pay them as agreed then\
what happens is you have a good score you get more credit your limits increase and increase and increase well this\
happens in the business world as well but limits increase much faster in the business world than they do in the\
consumer world it's very practical to get $limit store credit cards in the\
business world within to days following the steps I'm going to outline here and to get those kind of limits on\
cash like Visa Mastercard cash credit cards within four to six months you could never do anything like like that\
in the consumer world but very possible in the business world because of what I'm going to teach you here today about\
how the payex score actually works so when we talk about business credit scores the business credit score is a\
mathematical model that used to depict a business's risk of going days late on\
an account within the next months now business credit scores access a business's ability to pay not the\
business owners so why is this important it's important because your Consumer Credit doesn't matter period as a matter\
of fact I'm going to show you today how to build business credit leaving your Consumer Credit social security number\
off the credit report so if you're or off the application so if you apply for credit leave your social off an\
application they can't even pull your personal credit which means everything I'm about to show you of how to obtain\
and get business credit is completely independent from your Consumer Credit they're not even going to look at your\
consumer credit to make the decision to give you credit and to approve you for business credit unless\
you choose to give them your social and if you gave them your social on the application they will P pull your\
personal credit they will use it as a factor into the decision and you will be giving them a personal guarantee but if\
you follow the steps we're going to talk about then you'll be able to do that without the social being on the application no personal credit check\
takes place no personal guarantee is actually provided at that point so the\
business can use its credit scores to qualify for revolving store credit cards like Staples Lowe's Sam's Club Costco\
Walmart even MasterCard Visa American Express so most major retail stores\
offer business credit without a personal guarantee almost all of them do okay Target even used to except they just got\
rid of the no personal guarante guarantee component so almost all retail stores offer business credit with no\
personal guarantee most people haven't heard of this because it's not promoted when you go to Walmart when you go to\
Target they give you a % discount if you apply for their credit card right there as you go through the checkout\
line but they've never done that for you for business credit you've never even seen signage of them promoting that you\
can get a business credit card without a personal guarantee but almost all major retail stores do I could list them all\
on here I could list Costco I could list Chevron and I could list B BP I think\
which is actually on here I L almost all major retail stores Amazon Best Buy\
almost all major retailers offer no personal guarantee business credit you can even get MasterCard Visa American\
Express credit as well so the business can also qualify for credit lines and Loans but you have to be careful here a\
lot of high dollar amount loans even they're going to want a\
personal guarantee from you unless you have ridiculously wellestablished business credit so when you talk about\
building business credit you're primarily building business credit to get store credit cards and cash credit\
cards you also can get some equipment financing you also can get some even\
Auto vehicle leasing at some sources where they'll look at your personal credit but they'll use business credit\
as the driver and you can get that without a personal guarantee but primarily business credit is used to get\
credit without a personal guarantee you can sometimes get loans and credit lines when it's ridiculously well established\
so these business credit scores are always reviewed when you apply for a business loan credit card or any other type of business financing and this is\
something very important for you to know what happens is in the consumer world\
there's a law called The Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act says that if somebody pulls your credit they have to tell you\
they pulled their credit and well you have to give them permission first of all then they have to tell you that they pulled your credit and what information\
they use to determine if you got denied for example but in the business World there is no Fair Credit Reporting Act so\
what happens is when you apply for a bank loan when you go to on deck and apply for a cash advance when you apply\
with your bank for a business credit card they are pulling your business credit in all of those factors so I'll\
give you an example we had a client come to us that has consumer credit scores has a business that's very well\
established does I think threemillion a year in business they keep a lot of money in their bank account over\
$they keep in their bank account at any given time they applied for a\
$business credit card and got denied and the reason on the denial is business credit and I know this because\
we get a lot of these denials our clients when they come to us initially we ask for them we say well do you have\
a copy of that denial letter and in a lot of webinars I'll actually show those denials so we have tons of denial\
letters from merchant cash advaned companies like on Deck from actual big Banks from even business credit cards at\
places like regions and Bank of America and Chase where people are applying even with good credit even with money in the\
bank and still get denied because they don't have their actual business credit establish so they are pulling your\
business credit for all business credit cards and loans and if you get denied in large part they might not tell you a lot\
of the reason is probably because your business doesn't have a well established credit to qualify so the payex score\
ranges from zero to and a is the best score a business can obtain is\
perfect it's like the equivalent of an credit score in the consumer world\
now a score of or higher is considered good or healthy credit and literally means as you're about to see\
that this means that you just pay your bills on time so if you pay your bills on time or early you'll have a good\
payex score it all comes down to how you actually pay so a business can obtain a good business payex score by ensuring\
payments are made promptly to suppliers and vendors that's the key so you can\
get a good score as long as you pay your bills that are reported on your credit report mostly suppliers vendors credit\
issuers on time or early now personal credit score in comparison and I'll show you how these two differ from each other\
Personal Credit Scoring\
has five actual factors here's how your FICO score works if you didn't know this you know this now % of your score's\
payment history % utilization % length of credit history %\
accumulation of new credit % credit mix now I'm going to show you this compared to a payex score but before I\
do let me just give you some insight right here utilization on your personal\
credit is almost as much of a factor as your payment history look the math is the math % payment history %\
utilization this means if you overutilize the credit you have you damage your scores almost as much on the\
consumer side as if you paid your bill late not my opinion you can look that's the math so what does overutilize mean\
it's much lower than you may think it is if you have a consumer credit card with the limit of ,% of that limit when you exceed\
% you damage your scores you start to damage the scores so if you have a $limit consumer credit card and\
you owe more than $balance on that card you are damaging your scores how\
bad are you hurting your scores look at the math almost as much as if you paid the account late the further you are\
over utilized on that account the lower your scores will be okay I I've owned a mortgage company I can tell you that\
there was many people that didn't qualify because they owed three four five $more on a credit card than\
they should have and that kept them from getting a home loan because utilization is so important why does this matter to\
you as a business owner simple most people try to use their consumer credit to fund and bootstrap their business it\
completely crushes your personal credit when you do this personal credit was never designed to be used for a business\
and when you use it to try to fund a business then what happens is you damage or lower your personal credit scores as\
a result so this is why you want to build business credit one of many reasons because when you use personal\
credit to build your business you overutilize accounts and then as a result of that you damage your scores to\
a point where you can't get loans on the personal or Business site the other thing to mention here is that look at\
how these kind of play off each other payment history well in order to do that and get a good payment history you have\
to get accounts but when you apply for new accounts you lower the part of your score which has to do with accumulation\
of new credit or inquiries so mix of credit you need to have it's % of your score you need to have one to two\
mortgages you need to have one or two car loans but the minute you put a mortgage or car loan on your consumer credit report your scores drop because\
that loan is showing maxed out what you owe is what you borrowed it affects your utilization you lower that part of your\
scores when you get a mortgage or car loan on your credit you could lower your scores points just because of that\
utilization which isn't just revolving accounts it's all accounts so the bottom line is when you try to work on\
improving one part of your FICO you damage another part this is why it takes many years of welld disciplined\
borrowing to get a good FICO score but look at how this works in the payex score or in the business World here's\
D&B Paydex Score\
how your payex score works if you pay your bill early then you get a score if you pay it within the early discount\
period you get a score if you pay it on time you get an and if you pay it days late you get a so payex isn't\
like FICO in the sense that if you work on improving one aspect of the score you damage another and then you play this\
back and forth game for decades of your life until you get old enough where you have an type score because you've\
got all that formula worked out perfectly in the business world if you just pay your bills as agreed you get a\
good score so because of this all you really have to do to get an excellent payex score is you need to make sure you\
get a couns report to DMB you need to pay them on time or early and when you do this then within a couple months \
days or less you're going to come in and get an excellent payex score just because you got accounts that reported\
and paid your bills on time so much easier to get a good credit score and get high massive amounts of credit limit\
or massive amounts of credit with high limits in your business name because of\
how the payex score is actually set up so how do you do this well let's walk\
The Basics of Setting Up Your Business\
through the steps the first step is you've got to focus on the basics of setting up your business so you can't\
use a home address PO Box UPS address when applying for credit or you'll often get denied I just had one of these\
letters come into my email box today from Capital One the company applied for\
a Capital One business credit card Capital One sent them a letter back and said we aren't able to automatically\
approve you because we need your business address we don't need a PO Box address they used a UPS address they\
thought this looks like a legitimate address they used a UPS address on the application they got denied they didn't\
get denied they just said hey look this isn't a real business address we need your real physical business address to\
actually get you approved well there's nothing they can do because they don't have a real physical B business address\
they're operating out of the home they used the UPS address so this is why you want to use a solution like a virtual\
address from a company like Regis so you have a real physical address if you don't use a real physical address if you\
use a PO Box a UPS address or if you use a home address then you're either going\
to get denied in most cases or you're going to get one of those letters just like a customer actually got before they\
came into us to build business credit that says hey look we couldn't approve you because it doesn't look like you have a real business address so this is\
very important the address should be the same on all of your documents so your corporation documents your bank\
statement all public records all records they can find on your business should have the same address it needs to be a\
physical address one of the first real steps at building business credit is to set up your business entity as well you\
need to do a corporation or an LLC you do not want to do a sole proprietorship\
you do not want to do an actual partnership because if you do a soulle proprietorship or partnership you'll\
always be liable for what happens in your business so by definition entities really Define two things how you're\
going to actually pay taxes and liability for your company you want to choose entities that have the least\
amount of liability so if you're looking at this and going wait a second or you're hearing this going wait a second\
I'm a sole proprietor I'm a partnership you can still change your entity you could talk to your account and figure out how to change your entity it's not a\
difficult thing to do but the bottom line is if you want to be you want to be a corporation or LLC that's what\
eliminates your personal liability in your business you can't be a partnership and go get business credit and expect\
not to be liable because a partnership by definition you are the business so\
you'll always be liable you need to separate that liability it's very important for your business now you can\
do this at your secretary of State website so you can go right to your Secretary of State website and get set\
up set up your entity it's fairly cheap very easy to do some states like California it's expensive it's like \
bucks Most states like Florida it's only bucks to get this done it's not a difficult or expensive process to\
actually get done now price to do this again depends on your state Florida \
bucks California bucks big change and how much these things actually cost\
to do so the first step to set up your business is to think of a company name and then set up your entity with the\
Secretary of State in your state so you might want to write down two three different business names hey I want to\
choose credit Suite then you go to your Secretary of State website do a search to see if anybody else has that name if\
they don't have that name then you want to go ahead and start the process of setting up your entity usually a very\
fast process to do okay I can set up an entity in the State of Florida in less than five minutes on their website for a\
cost of bucks so first look to see if desired names available and if so then\
if not then go ahead and register for that name if so then pick a different name so next set up your EIN number for\
free from irs.gov website okay so on irs.gov don't go to any other website\
because they'll charge you for your EIN and it should cost you absolutely nothing then use the corporation papers\
and the Ein to set up your actual business bank account now you'll need to\
use your social when getting your e in and you might need to use a real physical address not a virtual address\
so when I'm talking to you about using a virtual address and a virtual address\
instead of a PO Box you can't do this when you get your EIN another question a lot of people say is they say well wait\
a minute how can I build business credit without my social being on the application they ask for the social on\
the Ein application yes they will that's okay that by itself doesn't make you\
personally liable for what happens in the business so you can add the social you'll have to add the social when you\
get the EIN number they won't let you set up a company in the United States unless you have something like a Social\
Security number so you've got to have a Social Security number and I say like because if you are a foreign entity and I'll do a webinar or a show on this a\
different time there is a way that you can use something else in Li of a social security number but that's a whole other\
show that we'll do that on so they're going to ask you for the social when you set up your EIN that's okay here's a\
Google screenshot of what you get when you click EIN number into Google see the very first thing that pops up federal\
tax ID number I'm pointing with my finger instead of my mouse you obviously can't see that this is one that will\
charge you for this okay look down here number two irs.gov you want to go to one\
with an irs.gov URL this is the only way that you're going to get an EIN number\
without actually paying for that EIN number so then use that Corporation the corporation papers you'll get so you\
Getting Your Business Started\
file the corporation online they give you papers they'll even give you the option of downloading them right away then you use those and you get your EIN\
set up once you have your EIN set up at irs.gov which costs nothing then the next step is that you've got to get your\
actual business bank account set up usually only cost about to bucks to actually set up your business bank\
account and actually do deposit deposit there and even if you've had issues in the past with your bank your business\
won't be affected so a lot of people are nervous about this they go man I don't know how I'm going to set up a business\
bank account because the truth is I had problems on the personal side and now I'm in check systems and I'm never going\
to get a business credit account well don't worry about it if you're in check systems because you've had some kind of\
default or problem on the consumer side you can still set up your business without an issue we've helped clients\
through this process so even if you burned a bank before and you're in the it's the in check systems where you\
actually are prevented or it's difficult to get a consumer bank account you could still get a business credit or business\
account even if you've had that problem in the past so don't feel that that's a barrier it's not okay get any Required\
licensing for your industry State County federal government look you're gonna have a hard time getting credit if they\
go to look and they see that you're an unlicensed entity and let me tell you what's happening nowadays everything is\
Shifting online and I'll give you an example you've probably heard of the rocket mortgage from Quicken I actually\
happened to be in Washington DC last week and I happened to run into the lobbyist for four quick in loans and I\
spent like a ton of time with him and I was very interested in a lot of things and you know I said how does this work with this rocket mortgage he said it's\
the almost unbelievable thing you've ever seen what happens in our system is our system pulls all the data now from\
all these other places and brings it in automatically I said what are you talking about he goes your tax returns\
everything now it goes out it spiders it finds it and brings it in our system I\
said so you're telling me I can get a mortgage without even supplying my tax returns he goes we don't need you to we already pulled your tax returns in\
automatically guys this is where the future is headed so what happens is your licensing your address all these things\
these computer systems are now checking they're making sure it's a real physical address they're making sure you have the\
proper licensing and all of that is now being brought into these systems to determine your approval or denial so\
this is why you have to meet this criteria and get your business started the right way because if you don't then\
what happens is when you go to apply all these spiders that are put out there to check make sure online that you have\
your business set up the right way that you have a real physical address and phone number and all these things are set up automatically are pulled into the\
computer and they know right away whether or not you meet the criteria or not and I gave you that example of a\
prospect that came into us and they came into us to build business credit because this exact same thing happened they went\
to their bank they got a virtual they had a virtual ad or excuse me they had a business UPS address and automatically\
when they applied for excuse me not not their Bank Capital One Capital One system said we need more information to\
make a decision we're going to send you something in the mail that's because Capital one's computer system picked up\
that they were using a UPS address so all this happens now by computers so you've got to make sure that you meet\
this criteria now you want to next set up your website an email address with GoDaddy and a site like monster\
template. comom look I don't care where you have your hosting I don't care where you buy your do domain or your email\
address but I use GoDaddy that's who I use they're cheap for bucks you can get a URL you can actually get an email\
address to go with that you can go to a place like monster template. to get a website template and use a place like\
upwork.com to have somebody put up a Prof professional website for you super cheap now don't get me wrong if you look\
at our website credit.com obviously wasn't for Monster template. comom when you get a really professional website\
you'll spend five to $or more for it but if you're just getting started in the early stages\
it's easy to go to go daddy spend bucks for a URL they'll give you a professional email address as well and\
now you can go get a a website template a place like monster template use a site like upwork to come in and put up your\
website for very little money it's so cheap to do why am I telling you this because you can't have some lame website\
or no website up and then go to try to fill out an application for a $credit card it won't work they're\
looking to make sure you're credible they want to make sure you have a real physical address they want to make sure that you have the proper licensing they\
want to make sure you're using a professional email address like mine is thac credits.com that's linked to my URL\
they want to make sure you have a professional website so there's a cheap and easy way to do it and again as your business grows you can focus on spending\
more money in those areas set up your phone number with a company like ring central again I'm recommending companies\
we use that's why I'm actually recommending them we actually use fonality for our phones but they're very\
expensive when it's not that they're very expensive they can be very expensive bucks a month or more\
maybe not something you want to do in the beginning stages but ring central is fantastic you get a local number you get\
a toll free number you get a fax number and ring central will give it all to you in one number for like bucks that\
well they'll give you a toll-free number and a fax number in one number and they'll also give you a local number it's not very expensive you need to have\
a professional phone number you need to have a fax number you need to have a toll-free number you can't use a cell\
phone you can't use a home phone because remember as I said these computer spiders are checking to make make sure\
that the phone number you're giving them is a real physical phone number for a business not associated with your actual\
home or so cell phone now people ask what about a a Google phone number online virtual business phone numbers\
are fine you just can't use a mobile phone or a home phone on that application or it'll get you denied and\
again you can get things like your fax number tollfree number allinone you can even get a local number which it all rings to the same place okay and you\
want to set up your local number with very important we use a service called list yourself list yourself from\
last time I heard charges about bucks a year to get listed with this I thought was simple I used to think you\
could just go to and get your phone number listed apparently you can't it's not very simple at all to do but a\
company like list yourself will get you listed with there is a cost per month it equates to about bucks now\
is there a way around it not that I know of okay what I can tell you is I can tell you that you know we pay for it so\
with our clients we pay for list yourself as well okay so I think you're probably going to have to pay for it\
because I know it cost us to do that actually for our clients as well so 's essential because initial credit\
issuers want verification that your business is legit is one of the most important things you could do because\
when we get into initial creditors that can approve you which we'll talk about here a little bit later they want Ein\
and those are the two things are listing looking for so if you think you can skip this step you can't skip the\
step you'll never even get off the ground because to get initial credit with initial vendors when you have none\
they're going to look for a they're going to look for Ein if you don't have these you will not get set up there's\
also a ton of other places you can have your business listed as well all of which make you easy to find and show\
that you're actual credible now I don't want to actually get in that today but I will show you that right here on our\
actual YouTube channel which is creditsuite.com um youtube.com\
sledit credit Suite you'll find that we have a video get your business listed correctly to meet credit issuer and\
lender criteria or you'll get denied and this will actually show you everywhere that you can go to get your actual\
business listed so obtaining a duns number is the first step towards getting an actual business credit score with dun\
in Brad street so one of the first things you have to do to get a payex score with them is you've got to actually get this dun's number okay so\
the dun's number is comes from dun and Brad street this is not what your business credit is linked to your\
business credit is linked to your EIN but your dun's number is the first step with dun in Brad street to actually get\
your business credit set up now this is called the data Universal numbering system or duns it's a business\
identifier code provided by dun and Brad street you'll often see I put duns without the dashes that's actually\
improper it's actually duns with the dashes in there okay separating the data Universal numbering system it's provided\
by dmbb okay this goes all the way back to and DNB has this worldwide so\
what's interesting about the duns number is that this is used in other countries it's used by Foreign governments it's used by trade associations okay so this\
is a nine-digit number issued by D&B and assigned to every business location in their database each having a unique\
separate distinct operation for the purpose why I put this up here and this is their definition is because DNB\
assigns a duns based on an address so you don't want to try to use a business address for multiple businesses or you\
will have really big problems because they'll merge your file together it creates all kinds of issues potentially\
so you want to try to make sure that you're using a virtual address that nobody else is using which most are set\
up that way or that you're not trying to piggyback off your buddy's business and use their address because that could mess you up especially when it comes to\
your duns number being assigned to that address so every business must have a duns number before D&B will assign a\
payex period they will not give you a payex score unless you actually have this duns number set up\
D-U-N-S Number\
okay so the duns number is then preferred method worldwide of identifying an actual business okay the\
unlike National EIN numbers a duns number may be issued to any business\
worldwide so an EIN number is only used in your actual State a duns number is\
used worldwide so Australian government can pull your duns number and recognize your business the Australian government\
doesn't can't pull your EIN number and recognize your business internally not that they couldn't go to Google and do\
this I'm just saying that the Ein isn't recognized in Australia but the duns number actually is it's used by many\
foreign governments the US and Australian government European commissions even the United Nations now why is this important to you because the\
government requires the duns number to do any kind of work with them such as a contractor so because of this the duns\
number has to be provided for free because they can't make you pay for it\
if you're coming in need it for something to be like a contractor so there are ways to get your dun number\
without paying for it because it is required by some government entities like us and Australia so just even for\
contractors if you go to do contractor work for the United Nations you would need to have a duns number before they'd\
even hire you so because of that that's what makes it where you can get this duns number without paying money to\
actually get it so there's Global industry and trade associations that also recommend or use the duns number\
okay so the duns number you can get for free even though D&B credibility does\
offer offer it as part of their credit Builder package now dun and Brad street does offer a credit Builder package and\
I'll talk about that a little bit later it has all kinds of benefits and it has some drawbacks too so things you should know about and they will wrap this duns\
number into that package and give it to you sooner they'll give it to you right away if you buy their credit Builder they'll give you your DS immediately if\
you don't buy that credit Builder it'll take you about days to actually get that duns number so first you'll need to\
see if you have a duns number already by checking I update next you go through the simple online process with D&B to\
get your duns number so you can go to dmb.com getet auns number all separated\
by a dash okay you can even go to Dun and Brad Street's eye update system to see if you have a duns number and right\
there it will lead you in to how to get a duns number so you can go right to dnb's website to get your dun's number\
to check and see if your business is located in I update to give them the information to get put in to ey update\
and to actually get your dun's number at no cost but again D&B credibility will also talk to you about buying that as\
part of a credit Builder package that they offer so when you complete your information online D&B credibility we'll try to call you and offer you the credit\
Builder package this is what happens so when you fill out your information online you're going to get a call from dun and Brad street credibility\
different company than dun and Brad street and they will talk to you about buying their credit Builder package it's\
not needed to get your duns number payex score or to activate your profile with DMB once you get your duns number for\
free which I just talked to you about how to do that well then what will happen is once you get credit that reports to Dun and Brad Street then\
that'll give you a pidx score then you can activate your credit profile with DMB automatically because that credit is\
actually reporting okay so also keep in mind D&B credibility is a separate entity from DMB themselves so for your\
free duns number you'll need to wait days for it to be delivered by mail okay you can expedite this but to do so\
you'll need to pay for the DMB credibility credit Builder DMB credibility credit Builder is a program\
where they'll help Implement existing accounts you have onto your actual business credit report and as part of\
that package with enrolling from them they'll even give you access to your duns number immediately you don't need\
to wait so if you want your free DS you got to wait a month to get it if you don't want to wait a month then you've\
got to get set up with their D&B credibility credit Builder because that is how you get it immediately without\
waiting and it'll cost you as little as $annually or bucks a month and\
this is from that same site dmb.com uer that's D and the word and the letter\
b.com cr-b Builder and if you look on their website you'll see exactly what I put here that you can get it for \
annually or a month again I don't work for dunor Brad street I don't represent Dunner Brad street or D Brad\
street credibility and this could change at any given time okay this was just the pricing when I just went on there a few\
days ago but this absolutely can change um at different times okay so beyond\
that again you do not need to buy this you can actually get that for free we talked about how to do that so the\
Credit Builder\
credit Builder does include credit monitoring it also includes a way for you to add some of your existing vendors\
to your actual DMB report now keep in mind most vendors you might want to add are not allowed to be added by DMB and\
I'll give you some quotes from their website um that I use for research for this actual show um to explain to you\
why that is but the bottom line is is that they'll give you access to your credit monitoring they'll give you\
access to a way to get your D's number for free or to get your done number immediately and then they'll also let\
you add accounts to your DMB report not Experian or Equifax but to your actual\
DMB report now this comes from dun and Brad Street's website dun and Brad street credibility some some trade\
references may not qualify for the following reasons DMB works together with thousands of Nationwide vendors\
that report payment experiences on a regular basis these providers have requested to remain anonymous and cannot\
be added by consumer for trade reference some types of companies do not respond to DMB request okay DM will make six\
attempts to contact the company it's been selected okay however a customer may resubmit references at any time so\
this is a problem I've heard in the past some people try to get references added to their DMB reports and DMB isn't able\
to make contact with them certain companies have proven over time to be less trustworthy which is another reason\
that they may not not let you add accounts and again here's exactly where I got this information dandb.com\
glossery trade d references it's exactly where I got this information copy and\
paste the following kinds of trade references are amongst those that are not acceptable by DMB payments that have\
not yet been made payments to businesses that have shared principles or some other type of legal ownership\
relationship Financial Services banks credit unions insurance companies Bank references utilities and gas companies\
credit card companies landlords virtual offices credit counseling or registered agents International companies\
businesses with an unknown sic so here's a list from them of account that can't be added as part of their credit Builder\
package now I'm telling you this because credit builder in theory sounds really good you go in you get accounts they add\
them to their D&B report but before you do this you should know the accounts that won't qualify so you don't waste\
their time trying to get them added and so when you're trying to make sure that the DMB credit Builder product is right\
for you you know what they can and can't add to help you with the right information to make the best decision\
okay and again I just showed you where this was dmb.com glosser trade. references okay so the\
Credit Monitoring\
credit Builder includes credit monitoring um it also includes and I already actually use that slide as you build your credit it's essential that\
you monitor your progress for this reason you should set up monitoring with at least D&B experience so in the\
business world you know you really can't get um and I have no idea why I have a\
picture of consumer credit monitoring on my actual slide here but that's a whole different conversation for a different day so you you shouldn't set up you can\
set up monitoring with eifax commercial but the reality is most sources used down in Brad street most sources use\
experient so you want to at least get reports set up with DMB and xerion because these are the ones most commonly\
used by credit issuers Equifax isn't essential you may want to look at your eifax report from time to time but I\
wouldn't pay a bunch of money to get your Equifax report because it's not as often used I would it's it's worth your\
time and money to spend the money to get DMB and Experian reports because the bottom line is is that just like you\
monitor your Consumer Credit you should be monitoring your business credit anybody can see this information keep\
this in mind so when it comes to business credit it's not like Consumer Credit where you only get your credit\
reviewed when you apply for credit in the business World anybody can look at your business credit reports and scores\
anybody can look at it I can look at it your competition can your prospects can your clients can Financial investors\
into your company people that you might want to sell your business any of these people can see what's on your business credit report without your permission so\
you should know what's on your business credit reports just because anybody else can access that information we put a\
link to all three of these on our website creditsuite.com reports you can go to them direct you can type in done\
and Brad Street Credit monitoring or experien business credit monitoring you can go right to their website and\
actually get set up with a credit monitoring so many people ask that we just put it in one link creditsuite.com\
reports and all we're doing there is just linking directly to those reporting agency sites so you can go to them\
direct or you can find them on our website either way so again this information I'm going to tell you might\
Getting Vendor Accounts\
change so what happens is you know I'll put something like that that's out here on a live show it'll go on our YouTube\
channel a year two years later it'll have thousands of views and then the information changes and somebody emails\
us and goes well you know reliable office supplies doesn't exist anymore because they got bought by Office Depot\
for example well these things change all the time but as of right now this moment\
in time this is exactly information that where you can get vendor accounts to get\
set up so you've got to start building business credit using what are called vendor accounts now these are accounts\
who offer terms such as net these are not revolving accounts these are creditors that will give you Net \
Terms which means you got days to pay the full Bill back in its entirety not like revolving accounts where you can\
make a minimum payment you must only work with credit issuers who do two things one give you credit when you have\
none two report that credit to the business credit reporting agencies when I say cras that's credit reporting\
agencies so when you first start building business credit you're only looking for two things that a vendor\
must meet one they'll give you credit when you have no business credit established without providing your social and they report to the business\
credit reporting agencies most sources don't okay and most sources don't because there's a volume requirement so\
for example some of the reporting agencies might require somebody have accounts monthly for them to\
report that data to DMB Experian Equifax whatever their requirements may be so most companies don't have clients\
to report monthly so they can't report to the business credit reporting agencies so you've got to find accounts\
that will give you credit when you have none and that they actually report it to the business credit reporting agencies\
do not put your social on the application when you apply for any type of business credit if you do two things\
will happen they'll pull your personal credit you'll be adding a personal guarantee if you don't want your personal credit looked at if you don't\
want to provide a personal guarantee don't provide your social if you do then go ahead and provide your social because\
that's exactly what they'll do is pull your personal credit and attach a personal guarantee if you are supplying a personal guarantee and your personal\
credit will be pulled then you make to make that approval decision actually this is the wrong way if you do and are\
supplying a personal social security number then you'll be adding a personal guarantee so the bottom line is if you\
don't want there to be a personal guarantee or social don't put your social on the app if you put a social on the app there's going to be a personal\
credit check there's going to be a personal guarantee a real business credit card for your EIN doesn't need your social to qualify this is something\
that you'll hear a lot of people say differently and that's okay some people call this commercial credit some people call this business credit some people\
call this corporate credit people call it all different types of things but my world I call business credit real\
business credit credit that you can get without putting your social on the application so when you hear me talk\
about business credit that's what I mean is your personal credit doesn't matter you don't need to supply a social to get\
it that's real business credit that's linked to your EIN and not your social so only apply if you've taken the prior\
steps don't even think about taking the steps I'm about to teach you of getting real credit unless you've taken the\
prior steps to set up your business credibly once you've done so you can apply at places like this Uline Uline\
sells they sell shipping supplies all different types of things that you can actually buy packaging supplies all\
those different types of things you can also go to quill and gimpl these places sell office supplies you can go to a\
company called monopolize your Marketplace they sell marketing supplies now couple things I want to note here UL\
line and quill these sources are known for maybe you needing to apply once\
twice or three times to actually get approved so if you follow the steps so you go to UL line and you try to apply\
for a business credit vendor account and they deny you well then don't worry about it just go ahead and buy $worth\
of stuff you need to buy $worth of stuff to get it reported $or more and then come back and apply again and if\
they deny you then buy another $worth of stuff and apply again now sometimes people get approved right away with no\
problem sometimes people have to come in and apply two or three times without\
their social to actually get approved for the account so just keep that in mind they may approve you right away if\
they don't don't get frustrated continue your order buy $or more with the stuff come back a second time come back\
a third time but in a lot of cases you can get approved without needing to apply two or three times another thing I\
note monopolize your Marketplace used to be really good offering really cheap\
services or marketing products say like a CD program you could buy for a little bit of money and build business\
credit in the process nowadays they sell a little bit more expensive marketing resources maybe you can use but just\
keep in mind it's not as cheap as it once was to get your initial credit with monopolize your Marketplace because they\
don't sell just a cheap four CD set like they used to do in the past make sure any other sources you try to get approv\
for report to the business reporting agencies there's all types of vendors out there all types of vendors but\
here's what you need to know % of them do not report to the business credit\
reporting agencies so if people are coming in and telling you things about getting approved without um or getting\
approved and how easy it is to get approved for vendor accounts that's just not true there's all kinds of vendor accounts you can get credit with but\
most of them don't report over of% of them don't report so even if you get approve with those sources and they\
don't report you're not really building business credit and I talk to these people all the time they come in to get\
business credit and the problem they have is that they thought they had business credit established because they have credit with all these vendors only\
to find out that none of those vendors actually report that credit so use your credit to purchase $or more worth of\
items or it won't report pay the bill quickly we now know why because the payex score based is based on how you\
pay so you got to pay your bill on time or as soon as you get it is what you really want to do or as soon as you can\
pay it you want to pay it that's going to get you in the to range remember again the payex score is all\
based on timely payments so the key is to pay your bill as soon as you can to get the highest score okay and why is\
that important because again we're talking about computer systems that now approve you so if a computer system\
looks your business is set up credibly they see three four five trade lines on there now the trade lines are reporting\
of an account like you line on your credit report and then they see you have an payex score boom that computer in\
a lot of cases will automatically give you the approval just because your business is credible you've got trade\
lines you've got a good profile you've got a good score because you paid your bills early and that's what you're looking for you don't want them to\
manually review your application you want their computer to go check check check check check approved and that's\
why we're going through these steps because if you meet Criterion follow these steps that's what you'll end up getting in a lot of cases so if you\
continue to pay your bills on time or early your scores are going to be to we now know why because all that\
score reflects is that you pay your bills timely if you pay your bill on time you'll have an score it takes \
days on average for these accounts to report after you use the credit and pay the bill so people ask me this question\
all the time how long does it take to build business credit and usually the first thing I do is I kind of laugh a\
little and say hey how long does it take you to to build consumer credit and they say well really it never stops I say\
it's the same thing in the business World it never stops you never stop building credit the only thing that defines time when it comes to building\
business credit is the time it takes for an account to report after you've paid the bill so if you get a UL line account\
and you pay the bill on time then you automatically once those accounts get\
reported we'll have a good score how long does it take for those accounts to get reported it takes up to days on\
average days so you can get an account right now with Uline you can pay the bill on time it can be on your report\
within to days I like to say days on average as soon as two to five of those accounts get reported that is\
when you'll actually get an excellent pidx score okay then that is what you'll use to start getting even more and more\
credit so you want to make sure you monitor reports until you see these accounts on your report you want to\
continue to use that credit each month during that time so you don't want to just go get you line get an account pay\
the bill off for get $more with the stuff and pay the bill what you want to\
do is you do that then you do it the next month then you do it the next month you want to continue that at least during that time frame that you're\
waiting for those accounts to get reported so if it takes two or three months to report go back to Uline two\
three times during that time to make sure you get your more credit and use more credit to make sure you actually\
pay your bill now let me say something else too look you might choose to use staples over quill but here here's the\
way I look at this if quill is willing to give you a shot when nobody else will\
Staples won't approve you for initial business credit quill will so if you get credit with quill then you can also get\
revolving accounts in the future with quill as well so don't just use quill just to get credit and abandon them and\
then move to Staples you might want to continue to use quill because they were there for you when other people weren't\
that's just kind of how I am I'm a loyalty guy okay so like for example when I first set up a business you know\
my won't give me a merchant account but yet other sources will then all of a sudden when I'm established my bank\
wants me to give me their merchant account I won't take their merchant account I want to stick with the guys that gave me a shot when nobody else\
would so just keep that in mind don't just use these sources to get credit on your report and then abandon them and go\
to other stores try to maybe stay loyal to them continue to buy things from them because again they're probably selling\
it to you for the same or discounted price and they gave you a shot when other companies wouldn't you've got to have five payment experiences to apply\
for the next step of store credit a payment experience is the account the reporting of one account to the business\
reporting agencies so if you have one account that reports to Dun in Brad street and Experian that counts as two\
payment experiences so the list I gave you earlier is more than five payment experiences because several of those\
report to multiple reporting agencies so you've got to have five reportings of credit basically between the three\
reporting agencies now it's going to take at least three accounts reporting to get your actual payex score as I\
mentioned okay once you have that payex score and five of those accounts reporting you're okay to start getting\
store credit this is because many stores want to see that you have a good payex of or H to approve you remember you\
got three accounts you paid them on time or early and then you they get reported that's what gives you that good score so\
Getting Store Credit\
with five reported accounts you can now apply for store credit most major retail stores will issue business credit\
without a personal guarantee as we talked about earlier but some do have stricter requirements than others so for example Staples Home Depot some of them\
require that you're in business for two or three years have tons of credit to give you revolving credit but most\
retailers out there if you have good scores profile some trade lines reported will give you actual credit without a\
Getting Cash Credit\
personal guarantee with a total of payment experiences you can then start to apply for actual cash credit which is\
Visa Mastercard that type of credit these will come from visa and MasterCard without a personal guarantee aex also\
offers no PG business credit but they usually takes a lot of established credit or longer time in business to get\
ax Discover at this point in time no longer offers no personal guaranteed business credit and again as I just\
mentioned aex will help also help you with cash credit it just takes longer to establish so once you do this keep\
Keep it up!\
continuing the same process apply and get more and more store credit apply and\
get more and more cash credit use that credit pay the bills timely and then\
your limits are going to grow and grow and grow and your ability to financing is going to grow as well that's really\
the same as Consumer Credit you get credit you pay your bills you make sure it reports to the reporting agencies and\
in doing so that's how your continue your credit continues to grow grow grow and grow so that's exactly how you go\
through the process of getting an excellent payex score within days or less okay that's exactly how you\
continue building your business credit to get five $cash limit\
credit cards in multiples that you can use for any purpose possible without the personal guarantee without the personal\
credit check also keep in mind you're not alone okay if you are interested in working with us we can help you build\

act um that so yes you actually can do that\
CFPB Is Deleting Collections?! Here's How to Do It\
the\
CFPB is finally cracking down on shady\
debt collection practices and this could\
truly be your golden opportunity but\
only if you know how to take advantage\
so I'm going to break this video down\
into four very important parts that you\
do not want to miss and there's also\
going to be a bonus at the very end of\
this video but here's the truth\
collections can drop your credit score\
over points they can block you from\
buying a home getting a car or even\
landing a job but now with this new\
pressure from the CFPB debt collectors\
are forced to prove the accuracy of\
their accounts or delete them if you\
don't take action while the door is open\
that collection could stay on your\
credit report for up to seven years let\
that sink in for a minute seven years of\
being denied years of higher interest\
rates or take minutes today and learn\
how to fight back now let's jump into\
Pull All Credit Reports\
part number one we need to pull all\
three credit reports because you need to\
see exactly what the bureaus are\
reporting so go to\
annualcreditreport.com\
and download your Equifax Experian and\
TransUnion credit reports and you can\
get them all for % free once a week\
now don't tell me it's once a year it's\
once a week it clearly shows it on the\
website and for those of you that are\
wondering why all three because not\
every collection appears on all of them\
and the CFPB is cracking down across the\
board this is your blueprint highlight\
every collection account circle the name\
the collector the date the amount\
everything about that account that's\
your battlefield and I also want you to\
pull all of your secondary credit\
reports from all the secondary credit\
reporting agencies like Lexus Nexus LCI\
Anovvice ARS Credco Clarity Data X\
Microbuilt and Factor Trust we cannot\
leave this on any other secondary bureau\
this is the reason why deleted items pop\
back up on people's credit reports\
because they only go after the big three\
but these collections and charge offs\
and negative items are also reporting on\
the secondary bureaus this is why we\
need to attack them and do not freeze\
the secondary bureaus because it's a\
waste of time you need to eradicate it\
everywhere now moving on to part number\
Check for Violations\
two we're going to check for violations\
here's where it gets juicy most\
collections have errors wrong amounts\
duplicate listings no original creditor\
listed listen to what I just said no\
original creditor listed if it was\
purchased by a debt collection company\
it must show the original creditor\
listed on the collection account on your\
credit report because the CFPB says if\
any of that is wrong the collection\
should be deleted so use this to your\
advantage compare the details across all\
three bureaus plus the secondary credit\
reporting agencies if anything doesn't\
match boom that's your ammo but here's\
the thing you do not want to just\
highlight one thing because you're going\
to tell them how to fix it highlight the\
entire thing the entire account that is\
a collection or charge off whatever it\
may be the negative item is hurting you\
highlight the entire account now moving\
Request a Purchase Agreement\
on to part number three we're going to\
send a purchase agreement request letter\
don't play this like an amateur and say\
"I want you to show me an original copy\
with my wet signature." You're asking\
for something that doesn't exist and\
they're going to laugh at you so if you\
hear somebody that says it on social\
media understand that they have no idea\
what they're talking about and they are\
paring information that is over years\
old because we want to put real pressure\
on them because right now is the time to\
put the pressure on them and request a\
purchase agreement because under the\
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act you\
have the rights to demand proof now\
let's put this letter up on the screen\
now understand you send this certified\
mail send a purchase agreement request\
letter ask for the original purchase\
agreement request you're going to ask\
for the original purchase agreement full\
payment history and proof they legally\
own this alleged debt and are legally\
able to collect on it if they can't\
prove they own the alleged debt they\
must delete it because they have no\
right to report or collect on it now\
before you come into the comments you\
say "But Mike what do I do if they send\
me the original purchase agreement?"\
They're not going to and the reason why\
because they can't show you the original\
purchase agreement as they have\
purchased this debt with other debt as\
one big debt ball purchase with hundreds\
or possibly thousands of other debts\
because by law the FDCPA\
protects everyone from stopping debt\
collectors from showing any information\
of your alleged debt to anyone else but\
the alleged person now if you thought\
that was powerful wait until you see the\
next part because even if they validate\
it you still get it deleted using this\
Use the CFPB\
part number four we're going to leverage\
the CFPB complaint system now remember\
the CFPB is a complaint system not a\
disputing system anybody that says\
otherwise is definitely lying because\
when you go to the CFPB website it\
clearly says start your complaint or\
sorry file your complaint so if the\
collector doesn't respond or responds\
with junk go straight to the CFPB now\
understand they currently only have \
employees because as we all know there's\
been this massive fiasco where they\
fired like employees from the CFPB\
but they are still working so you do\
still have the chance to use them and\
this is why this is very time-sensitive\
because we don't know if they're going\
to completely shut them down once the\
judgment falls or they completely\
reinstate everybody and then the CFPB is\
up and running full-fledged but\
understand there are still employees\
that are working there but once you go\
to the CFPB you want to file a formal\
complaint and include every single\
detail the accurate information the lack\
of verification the harm it's caused to\
your credit this puts federal pressure\
on them\
last part's the most important most\
companies would rather delete the\
collection than deal with a government\
investigation this is why it's super\
important for you to dispute it first\
because remember I'm going to repeat\
again the CFPB is a complaint center if\
you send a dispute letter to the CFPB\
they're going to look at you crazy like\
well what is this is this a what is this\
no this is a complaint center okay so\
understand when you dispute one round\
two rounds four rounds six rounds that\
is your proof that you have shown that\
they are not actually showing accurate\
complete or fair information and you use\
that against them using the CFPB this is\
the part that nobody talks about your\
dispute letters are your secret weapon\
now if this all sounds overwhelming it\
is but there is a faster way\uc0\u8198  \u8198  but\
what happens if you do absolutely\
nothing let's be real if you ignore this\
the collection will haunt your credit\
for years it'll keep your score low\
it'll keep your interest rates high and\
worse you'll keep paying more for\
everything meanwhile others are deleting\
accounts left and right because they\
took action this isn't about just\
cleaning your credit it's about\
reclaiming control of your financial\
future so here's what you need to do\
right now pull your credit reports\
highlight every collection use the\
purchase agreement request letter and\
dispute process as I shared it and if\
you want it done for you try Dispute\
Beast link is going to be in the video\
description for anyone that needs it i\
really want you to understand the window\
won't stay open forever the CFPB is\
watching but so are the collectors\
you've got the power now it's time to\
use it now if this video helped you make\
sure to smash that like button for more\
real credit gamechanging strategies and\
drop a comment below with the word fight\
if you're planning on fighting your\
collections this week i'll personally\
reply with tips if you need them so I\
hope you enjoyed this video we covered\
another big one on how to beat the\
collection companies at their own game\
What NOT to Do to Fix Your Credit!\
\'a0so I'm\
going to explain a little bit more about\
exactly how this secret letter is\
supposed to work and how you can get\
access to your own letter so then that\
way these letters aren't going into a\
black hole because now your creditors\
are notifying my attorney and\
unfortunately he's not going to be\
responding on your behalf cuz you did\
not retain him okay so buckle up your\
seat belts because I have a lot to cover\
in this very short\
[Music]\
[Music]\
video all right so going through all of\
this the most notable one obviously is\
the FedEx\
and then I have somebody who actually\
sent a card to probably one of their\
creditors actually was the to the credit\
bureau\
Transunion and then they had it sent\
back to my attorney because apparently\
you guys cannot follow instructions now\
I don't want to be rude and I'm just\
going to have a kind of a heart-to-heart\
conversation here because listen this is\
the reason why you're in financial\
demise right now it's because you can\
not follow with directions you don't\
want to take the steps the time the\
effort and the energy to be able to do\
something correctly you want to have\
fast everything in life and therefore\
now you find yourself in a situation\
probably in trouble with credit probably\
on the verge of bankruptcy probably\
having issues with maybe finding the\
right job or business that you can use\
profitably to be able to get yourself\
out of this financial Calamity that you\
find yourself in right now and none of\
that is going to change unless you start\
the process of really focusing in on\
doing things correctly okay following\
step-by-step instructions and if you\
didn't get it from the videos that I\
posted which by the way I posted a lot\
of videos about how to fix your credit\
and if you didn't get it the first time\
guess what there's a replay button hit\
it and watch it the second time the\
third time the fourth time because this\
whole credit stuff to be able to fix\
your credit and repair your credit and\
build your credit at the same time to be\
able to access the credit that you need\
the unsecured credit to be able to\
ultimately build wealth that's very very\
easy and very simple to do but I found\
over the years that those that are how\
do I put this gently are on the lower\
end of the IQ pool gene pool if you will\
they don't want to follow instructions\
okay and it's probably not not you I'm\
talking to specifically but there's a\
lot of people out there that just want\
to half-ass everything they want to slap\
everything together as fast as possible\
because there's this this raging hurry\
to be able to get someplace and they're\
not willing to take the time and energy\
it takes to be able to write out the\
steps and do\
them with Crossing every T dotting every\
I correctly the way it's supposed to be\
done so unfortunately my attorney is not\
opening any of these you did not retain\
him in his services so therefore he's\
not going to be responding to any of\
these creditors on your behalf so just\
to be clear when you fix your credit\
always always always start with\
disputing everything with the three\
credit reporting bureaus there's\
Experian Equifax and Transunion so\
everything that's adverse meaning that\
everything that's negative on your\
current credit reports right now you\
first and foremost write the step down\
since a lot of you just simply do not\
want to follow instructions because\
you're in such a hurry you're a in a\
hurry to get to Nowhere you're in a\
hurry to bust through a dead end to\
basically watch yourself fall off a\
cliff because you don't want to do\
anything correctly so take the time to\
do this right step number one is to pull\
your three credit reports I recommend\
you go to experian.com pull all three\
credit reports experient Equifax and\
Trans Union spend the $to do it\
get all three FICO scores as well now\
you have a starting point so step number\
one is everything that's negative or\
adverse on your credit reports write a\
letter a physical mailed letter to\
Experian eoa and trans unit all\
separately so that therefore you should\
have three\
letters and then you can use my credit\
templates my credit dispute templates I\
have the link in the description box\
below right here that you can utilize my\
free templates and you mail those\
physical letters not disputing online do\
not do that folks it never works it will\
blow up in your face don't be lazy\
physically mail these letters and make\
sure that you include to the credit\
reporting Bure a copy of your driver's\
license ideally it has your current\
address on it especially if you've moved\
in the last two years and at least two\
utility bills showing your current\
address if you do not have current\
utility bills with your name then the\
next best thing would be to show bills\
like your cell phone bill um maybe an\
insurance bill maybe a car payment Bill\
something like that or a credit card\
bill that shows your name and current\
address now if you've moved within the\
last two years make sure that in the\
very bottom of the letter you show your\
prior address within the last two years\
that's going to be around the signature\
line area Okay so to be clear first and\
foremost dispute with the credit\
reporting bureaus first experient\
Equifax TransUnion you're going to mail\
them a physical letter I strongly urge\
you to use trackable mail USPS Priority\
trackable mail or you can use certified\
mail to make sure somebody signs for it\
so you know the exact date that they\
received it because on the date that\
they receive it guess what that's when\
the -day clock begins they have \
days to complete the disputes that you\
have and you literally will dispute\
everything that's negative we're talking\
about charge offs we're talking about\
even a bankruptcy we're talking about\
foreclosures we're talking about\
everything that is negative okay\
collections collection agencies are the\
easiest to have removed but you always\
go after the credit reporting bureaus\
first write it down because you can't\
half ass this man this is your future\
your credit is everything these days and\
if you half asset guess what you're not\
going to get anywhere and you're going\
to end up making a big mistake just like\
a lot of my students have especially\
those that have been watching this video\
these videos that I do on YouTube all\
right so one once you do your first line\
of round of disputes about days will\
go by you'll start to receive\
correspondence from the credit reporting\
Bureau save every lick of paper you\
receive everything because if something\
falls off by law they cannot put it back\
on your credit report even if another\
collection agency takes it over it's\
illegal so you want to be able to save\
that paper trail in case somebody else\
decides to buy the debt and put it back\
on your credit if as long as it's the\
same original creditor that they're\
collecting on behalf of then you just\
show a piece of paper and say hey looky\
look\
you already removed this you can't put\
it back on my credit report even if it's\
a different credit uh collection agency\
you cannot do that that's illegal and\
you have to save all of that paper to be\
able to get that removed immediately so\
first and foremost you have to have a\
good filing system you should have in\
the very least a folder for Experian a\
folder for Equifax a folder for\
Transunion and you should also use a\
credit log as well so then that way you\
can kind of show the dates and\
you know when you mailed things out who\
you mailed it out to what the response\
was Etc and I recommend that you use\
that in an Excel spreadsheet log okay\
listen your future is on the line\
everything's about credit now and if you\
don't fix your credit and start\
rebuilding it you're going to be screwed\
if you're not already screwed right now\
okay so you need to do this correctly\
now that's when I recommend you do the\
second round of disputes so after the \
days if certain things don't come off\
you go back to the credit reports and\
say what didn't come off and then you\
start your second round of disputes and\
I also urge you to do a third round so\
all of this communication back and forth\
by way of physical mail needs to happen\
with Experian eifax and Transunion which\
are the credit reporting bureaus only\
that's it you only focus on them first\
if that's not working then and only then\
after your third round of disputes if\
things are still not coming off then and\
only then can you contact the creditors\
directly we're talking about the\
Creditor or the collection agency and\
you demand that they show proof of your\
debt this is Step number two proof of\
your debt by way of you know some kind\
of statement some kind of contract some\
kind of agreement okay because by law\
they have to show you an agreement upon\
request and if they don't have the\
agreement or don't you know a lot of\
collection agenes simply do not have the\
agreements because you know they're in\
storage someplace or somewhere else in\
which case you're off the hook right\
because by law you have the right to see\
that agreement and so what you do is you\
send them a certified letter in the mail\
all right you do not offer up again\
write this down do not put a copy of\
your bill in there do not put a copy of\
your driver's license do not do any of\
that that's only for the credit\
reporting bureaus which again are\
Experian Equifax andur unit you do not\
put in a copy of your driver's license\
or copy of utility bills or anything for\
the Creditor or collection agencies you\
never do that okay so you basically send\
them a letter saying you know according\
to my records according to my credit\
report it's showing that I owe this that\
and I need to see proof of our of my\
agreement I need to see proof I need I\
need you to show me proof that there's\
some kind of agreements or some kind of\
account or some kind of something many\
times they will send you a statement\
well anybody can whip up a statement on\
their QuickBooks right a statement is\
not a legal agreement so you need to be\
on the lookout for an actual legal\
signed agreement by you that you signed\
okay now many times they'll either not\
respond or they'll respond with some\
statement a statement is not proof of\
your account again I can create a\
statement on my Quickbooks showing that\
you owe me a million dollars that\
doesn't mean that it's real okay anybody\
can generate a statement on their\
computer that's not a real legally\
binding agreement you have the right to\
see your legally binding agreement and\
if they don't have it well then it comes\
off the credit report okay but you have\
to send it by way of certified United\
States Postal Service mail in which case\
remember this green card I showed you\
this was from one such of those of those\
uh Communications but instead they did\
it with TransUnion you could do this\
with TransUnion use one of these green\
cards however it's really not necessary\
I like to use USPS Priority with with a\
uh you know just a confirmation delivery\
confirmation that's fine when you're\
sending communication to the bureaus\
when you're sending communication to the\
creditors or collection agencies you\
should use this green card but do not\
use my lawyer's information on the back\
this needs to go to you that your name\
and address needs to be on this so then\
that way when the United States Postal\
Service employee gets a wet signature\
here\
they will pop this in the mail and you\
will receive this this is proof that\
they received this that they signed for\
your letter then you wait days they\
have days to produce some kind of\
proof that the account is yours if they\
fail then you simply go back to the\
credit reporting bureaus with a copy of\
this card in the copy of the letter that\
you sent saying hey Experian hey Equifax\
hey TransUnion guess what I sent this to\
this creditor or this collection agency\
and I got this card so it's I have proof\
that they received it and this is the\
copy of the letter and I demanded that\
they send me um a copy of my agreement\
or some kind of proof that I have this\
account and then guess what they didn't\
send me anything you know they didn't\
send me anything and so you need to Now\
by law take this off my credit all right\
you always send them the copy of the\
card not the actual card because you\
need this for your file all right so\
that is that is the second step the\
third step is then to bring in what I\
like to call the big guns and that is to\
use my template from my attorney my\
attorney not yours you need to create\
have your own attorney which means you\
need to find your own on either Fiverr\
or or you know put somebody under\
retainer or something which is going to\
be too too costly for you in many cases\
so just go to fiverr.com type in um\
Attorney Services and many times you\
will find an attorney that can offer up\
a letter like the one that I provided\
now I will provide you with the the\
letter in the description area however\
hello this is my attorney this is just a\
template to be able to utilize all the\
verbiage that's on the template\
right and then you have your attorney\
somebody on Fiverr for $to $who's\
an attorney who can create a letter for\
you to say this is the letter I want but\
it needs to be on your letter head okay\
so that's where everybody seemed to\
screw up and that's why I have a whole\
bunch of letters in fact here they are\
and this is like I said the third box\
and he's like what do you want me to do\
with these I'm like well you're going to\
have to throw these away because you\
know they didn't these people didn't\
retain you so unfortunately you know\
there's a whole box of letters just like\
it would take me all all day to go\
through this box plus the other two\
boxes that I got I'm like I'm not\
opening these because this is everybody\
else's legal stuff and it has nothing to\
do with me but he was a little peed off\
to say the least so follow directions\
okay cuz if you don't follow directions\
if you continue going through life and\
you don't want to follow any instruction\
or any IND directions then you're just\
going to constantly keep floundering\
about being miserable being broke being\
having no credit having a low credit\
score you're going to continue going\
through life basically being a loser if\
you don't want to follow instructions\
because you're in such a mad freaking\
hurry that you're not willing to\
actually go through the due diligence\
process and do things correctly by\
dotting all your eyes and Crossing on\
your tees why be in a massive hurry when\
that's not going to help you get to the\
point of success that you need to be\
able to get these things off your credit\
to start the process of rebuilding your\
credit and to ultimately get the FICO\
score that you need to be able to start\
the process of getting the unsecured\
credit that you want to use to build\
wealth for yourself or to start a\
business or to buy a business or\
whatever it is that you want to do all\
right so I don't mean to be that hard on\
you but you got to follow instructions\
otherwise you're never going to get\
anywhere in life all righ\
Remove STUDENT LOANS from Credit Reports \
forgiveness I'm going to teach you the\
secrets to removing them from your\
credit reports so you better stick\
around my name is Daniel Rosen and\
welcome to credit repair business\
Student Loans and Student Loan Forgiveness\
secrets for most Americans student loans\
are a necessary step to getting a good\
education and building a dream life but\
when payments are missed and students\
loans go into default they can become a\
credit nightmare the good news is that\
there are several proven ways to remove\
them from credit reports and I'm going\
to explain them right now everyone who\
does credit repair knows that student\
loans have been a huge problem long\
before politicians started talking about\
forgiveness student loans are now one of\
the largest sources of Consumer Debt in\
the United States and they impact more\
than just the primary borrower if the\
loan had a co-signer their credit is\
affected the very same way as the\
primary borrower and in % of\
undergrad private student loans had a\
co-signer million Americans nearly\
one out of five adults have student loan\
debt individual borrowers owe an average\
of about\
$and collectively they owe\
$trillion in federal and private\
student loan student loan forgiveness is\
a hot button issue because the Supreme\
Court is currently deciding whether or\
not to pass the Biden administration's\
forgiveness plan if it passes the plan\
will wipe out up to\
$of student debt for the \
million borrowers already approved for\
debt cancellation and it will erase the\
entire student loan debt balance for \
million Americans but if the plan fails\
the US Department of Education under\
secretary James caval he warned that\
there could be a historically large\
increase in the amount of federal\
student loan delinquency and defaults\
roughly % of Americans have already\
defaulted on a student loan and % of\
student loan debt is currently in\
default so buckle up credit Heroes\
whether the student loan forgiveness\
plan passes or fails millions of credit\
reports are about to change here's the\
How Student Debt Impacts Credit\
thing to remember student loans affect\
your credit the very same way other\
installment loans do if you pay them\
back as agreed it's great for your\
credit but if you make late payments or\
go into default in collections it can\
seriously damage your credit and hurt\
your long-term Financial Health student\
loans live on your credit report for up\
to years and they impact your credit\
whether you're the original borrower or\
the co-signer the the good news is that\
there are ways to remove student loans\
from credit reports and they're not as\
difficult as you might think the first\
The Two types of Student Loans\
step is to understand that there are two\
types of student loans federal and\
private and they report to the credit\
bureaus differently Federal loans will\
report late payments to the credit\
bureaus after days and after days\
they will report the loan as defaulted\
private student loans make up only % of\
all student loans debt and they're more\
difficult to remove from credit reports\
because they're not backed by the\
government and they are riskier for\
lenders private loans typically report\
late payments to the bureaus after \
days and after days they will report\
the loan as defaulted either way these\
student loans will be listed on your\
credit report as delinquent until all\
the past due payments are repaid at this\
stage disputing with the bureaus or the\
furnishers is an option but if the\
accounts are delinquent and still\
reporting late payments deleting the\
accounts from the report will usually\
only be a temporary fix here's why this\
is important it's temporary because the\
furnisher will usually re-report the\
past du loan again and again and again\
so a Band-Aid won't fix this you need a\
long-term solution now most lenders have\
programs specifically designed for\
people who can't pay now but intend toay\
pay in the future once they find a job\
or get through some personal hardship\
and sometimes this is the most viable\
option federal student loan lenders have\
different repayment plans that allow\
people to pay less than required based\
on their income and that's a great\
option because lenders often reage the\
accounts after a few ontime payments and\
occasionally they'll even remove the\
late notations also some Federal Loan\
lenders offer forgiveness programs when\
you no longer owe the debt so check if\
you qualify now Federal Loan lenders may\
also offer deferment where payments are\
put on hold for months or even years an\
example of a pause is the relief policy\
that stopped Federal loan payments\
during the pandemic which is also\
scheduled to end after the Supreme Court\
makes its decision private student loan\
lenders don't have forgiveness options\
but they usually have refinancing and\
consolid ation plans available to you if\
you or anyone you know is struggling\
with student loan debt the best thing\
you can do is to help them to get their\
accounts under control first and then\
move forward with a dispute strategy\
The Secret to Disputing a Student Loan\
here's what you need to know the secret\
to disputing a student loan is not\
disputing it right away Bruce palatano\
the guru of student loan disputing and\
one of our millionaires club members\
here at CRC he recently shared his\
proven dispute strategy with with me\
Bruce has helped thousands of clients\
with their student loans he even teaches\
other businesses how to help their\
clients with student loans because\
How to Remove Federal Student Loans\
private loans are much less common than\
Federal loans and circumstances vary\
greatly when negotiating with private\
lenders the following tactics focus on\
removing Federal loans step one\
consolidate federal student loan\
consolidation means you have the\
Department of Education combined\
multiple old Federal loans into one new\
Federal Loan when Federal loans are\
Consolidated you basically create a new\
loan to pay off the old ones the old\
loans are then reported to the credit\
bureaus as paid in full and closed and\
when they're reported they don't say\
that they were paid in full through\
consolidation they instead report\
exactly as if you mailed them a check\
and paid them in full you can find more\
information on federal loan\
consolidation at student a.gov and I'll\
put a link over there in the show notes\
step number two dispute once the new\
consolidation loan is reporting and the\
old problem loans are listed is paid and\
closed it's time to dispute them as\
always start by disputing any incorrect\
information on the credit report student\
loans are a common place to find errors\
closed accounts are often listed as open\
loans can be wrongfully listed under\
your name and the very same loan can be\
listed multiple times so be extra\
thorough when you check that report\
beyond that the tactic that's proven\
most effective for Bruce is to dispute\
directly with the furniture this\
strategy often gets results because it\
uses section of the fair and\
accurate credit transaction act which\
states that you have the right to\
dispute directly with the original\
creditor here you would send a debt\
validation letter to the original\
creditor and demand the promisory note\
and you can download that letter for\
free at creditrepair cloud.com dispute\
- letters SL debt D validation a\
promisory note is the instrument of\
indebtedness so demanding the promisory\
note is a demand to see proof that you\
indeed owe the debt including the agreed\
upon terms between the two parties such\
as the maturity date principle interest\
and issuer signature and if they can't\
provide it and very often they can't\
demand a deletion this two-step\
consolidation and dispute proc process\
works because student loans are hard to\
get rid of unless the borrower becomes\
current that's why it is critical to get\
the loans under control first and then\
you have a good shot at permanently\
removing the negative history here's my\
final Point removing student loans can\
be difficult but it's not impossible all\
it takes to succeed is the right process\
and the right tools and I'll end by\
Business Credit Expert: The $K Funding Blueprint You Should Know\
first thing you need to take is like you need to do some mindset work because a lot of us you know either watching this\
episode or a lot of us that were in a position of needing to clean our credit before if you're leveraging someone\
else's service to do it you know or even just doing it on your own you have to understand that it is going to be you\
you might have messed your credit up over years it is not going to be fixed in days You know there are\
people who do get these insane results we're getting insane results for our clients as well but you can't always\
expect someone else's results to be a direct indicator of exactly how your process is going to go So I would say\
the big part right off the bat is just the mindset If two people go to the gym at the same time they do the same\
workouts they're eating the same food one person might have a six-pack in days the other person might have a six-pack in three years you know and and\
that's just the reality of what it is So the first thing I would say is is just understanding the mindset number one And\
then the extension of that mindset part is the credit bureaus are not your friend For whatever reason they're swamp\
There's people sending thousands of letters The credit bureaus are not your friend They're going to report things inaccurately Whether it's credit builder\
accounts positive accounts negative accounts they're going to report things inaccurately So even as we transition to\
talking about like okay let's build this credit out you have to understand they're not going to play fair So you're\
going to you'll you'll stress yourself out thinking that like why are they reporting this negative item or why are\
they why hasn't this hit all three of my credit bureaus or whatever it might be So I would say definitely you want to do\
like some some some heart surgery and some mindset work there as it relates to understanding like this is a process and\
and when we talk about foundations whether it's building a house or whatever it may be you don't want to\
make the foundation be the quickest part that you do you really want to spend time there so that as you really build\
out this this house or whatever it may be you know you really have built something that you can do cosmetic work\
to but the foundation is strong regardless of what's going on I mean in Texas there's houses that have been up since like early s and stuff So\
foundation there So next thing I would say is we want to build our credit out So assuming a person has you know\
assuming and I'll even go here assuming a person has bad credit technology has just completely changed the landscape to\
where we have things like chat GPT where if you want to clean your own credit you can go on chat GPT and you can do things\
like draft me a letter to remove a late payment you know um using laws using\
consumer law or using metro and chat GBT can put this letter together and then just Google the address to the\
credit bureau so you can create those letters for whatever the negative items are on your credit report So that's how you can remove some of the negative\
items Now as we transition into talking about building the credit because that's I mean that's the most important part A\
lot of people talk about credit builder accounts A lot of people talk about primary accounts So might as well do\
some education on what those are first before we kind of get into some of the best ones So a credit builder account usually is an account that you know\
maybe a secured loan maybe a secured credit card different things where you can put up your funds and secure that um\
those banks or those lenders can trust that you're going to pay those debts and then if not you have put up the money\
kind of as a security that they can take it if you didn't pay it on time or whatever it may be So those are accounts that what people don't realize are so\
important because if you have negative items on your credit report you go and get those credit builders and you're\
paying them on time Your credit doesn't always have to be perfect This is a misconception a lot of people have They\
think that your credit has to be perfect to go and apply for things Sometimes you know it's as simple as applying for\
something and removing a hard inquiry So if you have those credit builder accounts a lender who sees you may have\
a paid off auto loan with a bunch of late payments they could see that you have a credit builder for the same\
amount of those payments It's like oh he's been paying it on time for a year Yeah we can use that history and look at that as an example of why we can extend\
credit to him for an auto loan or whatever it might be So those are the credit builder accounts As far as the\
primaries go you want to look stable right anything that's in your name is what I tell people a primary account is So auto loans student loans um credit\
cards different things like that Um so you can go and add primaries as well And usually you want to have to \
accounts So I know we talked about this before but ideally for me that's the foundation That's the minimum We want to\
have to accounts We want it to be a mix of primaries and credit builders but we own a Marvin France show We got\
to get saucy We got to show them how to how to get some primaries the easy way Cool So so starting out with a blank\
credit report some of the easiest things that a person get approved for are an auto loan So you know for whatever\
reason they'll give a -year-old $worth of student loans but they won't give you $business loan\
Yep So with an auto loan you can go leverage banks like Lightream um whoever you bank with A lot of the credit unions\
give out those auto loans as well but you can go and get an auto loan like Lightream and you can go and get a\
$auto loan $auto loan and you can do things like go and get an auto loan You can either pay it right\
back Okay now we have a paid off primary on our account But what I like to do is this we we getting saucy What I like to\
Auto Loan Stack Play to Add Tradelines Fast\
do is I like to have my clients go and get an auto loan You have to be responsible Don't go spend the money on\
a new Rolex Don't go spend the money on on a boob job or I don't know whatever else you I got to talk crazy but but\
talk spicy but don't go spend the money on something you don't need Yeah So you can go and leverage getting an auto loan\
from a light stream or someone who deposits those funds or a Navy Federal someone who deposits those funds into your account and then let's say you bank\
with Navy Federal Let's say you bank with whoever then you can go and get a couple secured loans because some banks\
like Navy will allow you to have let's say up to three So let's say boom we're going to show you how to get four accounts So you go and get the auto loan\
They give you cash Now I'm going to go take out of that auto loan\
And then I'm going to go say "Okay Navy let me get a signature loan or let me get a secured loan." You can put up your\
They'll hold that and give you a loan And then you can pay back let's say\
$And then you can pay that $back over months So let's say you pay that back\
They give you that those funds right back the $go get another one for for for$ Okay then they give you\
You pay that back and then that's two accounts And then boom you can just keep continuing to pay it off\
And then now you have let's say bucks that you end up having to pay off for that You can go ahead and pay those\
accounts off And then you can pay that auto loan off as well And and that's four primaries right there So we have\
one primary from Lightream that's around anywhere between like to to And then we could take a portion of that\
loan and pretty much roll it into three more secured loans with a bank like a Navy Federal So we essentially have four\
secured loan or four loans that are showing on our report as primary accounts paired with the credit builders\
that we have on there paired with the credit builders like kickoff self You got rental karma We all have to live\
somewhere whether it's your grandma's basement or or your apartment You can go and backdate that rent and you can use\
that history and they ask you to just put a reference to whoever the landlord is So if you're staying with your\
grandma your grandma's landlord just just let Granny know like "Hey look they're going to be calling saying that that I'm paying rent here Hopefully\
you're paying your grandma something so you don't need her to lie cuz she like well I'm not going to tell them you paying here You ain't paying \
here." So you can have someone even if you have a roommate or whoever be that\
person that is that acts as your landlord and you can backdate and report your rent on your credit Um like I said\
Kickoff Self Boom Pay Ava there's so many out there And then not only that you can go and do the secured credit\
cards as well with that those same funds from that auto loan And then you can go and get a secured credit card where it's\
like okay I've paid this credit card on time I'm using it for things that I'm already doing in everyday life And then\
now they're going to turn that into um unsecured credit And then you can then go and get another credit card or end up\
paying off the auto loan And then they'll sometimes even double and triple whatever that original limit was So then you can just run it back with higher\
limits That's so we we're we're building our if we're starting from the foundation we're building with the\
credit builders So we have two to three credit builders like you said kickoff rent reporters all these different ones Then we swing over and we get a auto\
loan from liveream paired with two to three secured loans Then we now leverage that to now go and if I heard correctly\
get now start getting unsecured cards or getting secured cards So so you so you can do this and you can do the secured cards as a part of doing those loans So\
let's say you're banking with the Navy Um there's so many credit unions out there NIH um Andrews Pinfed all these\
different types of credit unions because everybody thinks Navy is the best one There's so many other credit unions out there that you can get that also give\
out those auto loans a little bit easier that you can do the exact same thing But you can go and get a secured credit card\
from those those credit unions and then eventually as you show good history they usually have a pre-approval tour They'll\
let you then turn that into a regular personal credit card and those credit unions are giving out the bag Yeah a lot\
of people a lot of people are stuck on the Axes and some of those cards but it's like if you don't have those strong\
primary accounts those strong personal credit cards already the AX's and the Chase's and some of these other banks\
aren't going to extend higher limits on those cards So you can go and get the high limit personal credit cards and and\
now let's say you got to accounts then you can slap a trade line on there because a lot of people think they can\
just add a bunch of trade lines and go get funding That's just a huge misconception But then you can slap some\
trade lines on there to to help with that age and and we can get busy on the business side if that's your aspiration\
So so much there So what you talked about how you know for you personally\
you mentioned a couple different names You talked about Navy Fed You also mentioned AMX and how you're more proponent of credit unions Are there any\
other banks that you once we've followed the strategy you've laid out Any other banks that if we want to start building\
out relationships on the personal side that you would also recommend us looking into man there's there's there's so many I would say I would say it depends on um\
it depends on which of your credit you know which of your credit bureaus are the best right because a lot of times a\
lot of people are so dead set on their entire credit report being clean before they get started But you got to realize\
the sooner you start all those accounts that you add you're getting more age as those months go by So if you're waiting\
until your credit's completely clean to add credit builders or to add whatever it might be then you're just prolonging\
the process of whatever your end goal is But um we got we got Dover we got Pinfed\
we got Andrews we got Langley um so many uh PCU um so many But and then you can\
use you can use credit boards and different websites that can allow you to go see okay like who do these banks pull from or to take it a step further you\
can just lock all your credit reports and then apply for the stuff and you'll see kind of who they pull for But with a\
lot of these credit unions what people don't know is they think that Navy Federal is the best credit union in the world which Navy is one of the great\
ones don't get me wrong but it's like when we do these episodes whenever we talk about these things and they become public information online you got to\
realize they start to move the goalpost especially people that look like us So there are other credits out there so\
many credit unions There's over banks in the US and they're looking for qualified people to give to that you can\
go and start relationships with these credit unions And they're they're easier\
to get into than Navy Because a lot of times with Navy you have to have an affiliate code or a member in the military But with a lot of these credit\
unions you just have to donate to you know a third party organization or something like the American Consumer\
Council or you know they might have you know with PCU I want to believe it's a Pennsylvania State Recreation Park or\
something It's like bucks but you can get into these credit unions You can get into these banks and they give out the\
bag a lot of times You can double dip with one inquiry to where you're not having to to bump your head with Navy\
Federal because Navy Federal's tightening up They are They are You said something before which I thought was\
also key too because I'm sure I get these messages and I know you probably get them too where people will message me You talked about trade lines and how\
there are I'll call them trade line warriors where it's like they think that they're going to authorize user themselves to to success to the Lambo to\
the of funding Then they go into these banks and they're looking at them like bro you have no credit And in their mind they think they do Could you talk a\
Trade Lines vs Primaries: What Actually Matters\
little bit about that because I think that's one of the bigger misconceptions that I'm still seeing people are struggling with when it comes to\
building out and understanding there's a big difference between focusing on building primary credit and leveraging\
our uh authorized users Man I I want to say this too because I talk to a lot of people like you said we have people all\
the time when people message you and they're like I want to get funding or I want to whatever it is they want to do\
This process is not just going to be an overnight process So if you're somebody that is watching this and you're like I\
want to get funding and you're in a rush or you're trying to like do these things you probably don't need any funding If you're in a rush to clean your credit\
and get if you need to clean your credit and then get funding you definitely shouldn't be in a rush You need to you need to get in position That's why you\
have to do that mindset work because a lot of times there's so many people out there with these trade lines that people\
are buying from and it's like for the cost of one trade line that you're paying somebody $$you can go and\
get six or seven credit builders kick off sell Some of these credit builders are only to bucks a month Yep And\
you can just and you can let them report and then close out That's what a lot of people don't realize You can close them out at any point in time to where\
they'll give you your money back and you still have that account on your credit report But with the trade lines it's an\
opportunity to piggyback off of somebody's credit which is is awesome But at the same time too that's a\
temporary boost That's not going to be a long-term solution that allows you to actually get in position So trade lines\
are for people who already have their credit built out and may need a couple\
points of a boost extra or maybe if your utilization is out of control maybe you want to add a couple trade lines so that\
you can maybe get a debt consolidation loan so that you can pay off some of your debts or or for someone who needs\
more age on their credit because they have a bunch of accounts but whenever they're applying for stuff they're seeing the denial reason is you know two\
new accounts or you know the age is not enough So those are the opportunities of when you should use trade lines Um they\
also help out as well whenever you want to go apply for certain banks So like let's say Chase for example you can go\
and add you know a a big limit Chase AU or trade line so that whenever you do go\
ahead and apply they're going to see oh somebody that this person knows whether it's a family member or whoever felt\
confident enough to put them on this AU card that maybe we should extend this credit to them as well Because what a\
lot of people don't realize is when you're being added to an AU they give you another card You know they issue\
another card for whoever is getting added to that AU But often times whoever selling that trade line spot or whatever\
it might be they're not giving you that card But from the bank's perspective if I've been added to an AU that's high\
limit for all they know I'm the one that's using this card And so that's the part where people are getting that history and that's why they help But\
those are something that you add in addition to the other stuff was not something that's supposed to be the foundation\
So you get you've given us the blueprint now on the personal side Now let's swing over to the business cuz that's we set\
up the personal so that we're able to get leverage on the business side Once we finish doing all that leg work of\
getting ourselves structured and organized there what's that first step look like of us getting funding on the\
Business Credit Setup: LLC, Address & Structure\
business side so I I think a lot of a lot of the stuff that you know whenever we talk about getting funding when we\
talk about building your credit what a lot of people don't realize is while if you're someone who's building your credit someone that's repairing your\
credit you should be doing all this stuff while you're doing that You shouldn't wait until your credit is\
fixed to set up your LLC or you shouldn't wait until it's time to get funded to set up your LLC While you're building your credit you should be\
sourcing whether it's a mentor or whatever you're going to do You should be writing that business plan you should be setting up that LLC doing those\
different things so that once it's time to actually go run those plays or get in position you're already ready You're\
just waiting on everything else to hit So with the LLC for example you know as\
it's time to to go and get funded we got to have the proper business structure Yep So whenever it's time to get funded\
you got to have the proper business structure a lot of there's a lot of information out there about escorps and\
or corpse and all this stuff um and how you can get more money and stuff like that But for the person that's watching\
this all you need is an LLC A lot of you guys are talking about these gurus are\
saying "Oh you got to get a corpse so that you can get the high limits of funding." Majority of these people and I\
don't want to say these people make generalizations but a majority of people don't need a million dollars in funding Don't need in funding Don't even\
need in funding to in funding should suffice to help you at\
least get started in whatever business model If you're someone that's trying to get into real estate I don't recommend\
going and get k in funding and then and then putting all the chips on you know So um you want to set up an LLC A\
LLC should suffice I got to say this too Look a lot of people will tell y'all go\
and get a a address from Opus or Regis or Alliance Things are changing with the\
industry and so many people are getting these addresses that banks if I'm giving you some money I need to know where you\
live at I don't want to know where where you telling me you live at or where you might have just put on the paperwork So\
there's nothing wrong with putting your address on the LLC Obviously you know you can have those you can have those\
virtual addresses but you know you shouldn't be doing shady business anyways to where people are trying to pull up on you but and obviously you can\
go and change it at some point but a lot of these banks are not extending credit to people who are using virtual\
addresses So that's one of the major changes that I've seen kind of in the industry So you can use your address to set up your LLC at the beginning or you\
can use the virtual office But whenever it's time to apply depending on the bank some banks they'll allow you to use your\
personal address even though you use the virtual address to set it up But some banks are going to say "No we need the\
address that you're using on the application to match what's on the paperwork." So for a lot of people using\
a if you don't have a brickandmortar business and you're just setting it up for the purpose of getting funding you\
need to just go ahead and put your address on there A lot of people are saying set up the LLC is human resources\
consulting general consulting We talk about lowrisk high-risisk industry stuff like that I'm cooking man I'm over here\
I'm I'm giving you the floor People talk about talk about these There's this is another misconception A lot of people talk about like high-risisk industries\
They've said to stay away from transportation They've said to stay away from trucking but if you're running a legit business it doesn't matter what\
industry you're in Obviously the financial industry a lot of times stocks publicly traded companies different\
things like that they might not want to extend credit to you But trucking transportation real estate these banks\
will give out credit cards You know especially the tier one banks the chases the Bank of America these big banks they\
have so much money them extending you know whatever it might be to a trucking or real estate company in\
the form of a credit card is not a big deal to them it it's once you get into like some of the loans and lines of\
credit and the cash things where it's like okay you got to look together on paper you have to be a profitable bit profitable business different things\
like that so you want to you want to set up your LLC properly um I I will tell\
people right now what I consider high-risisk would be the the consulting stuff you know if you want to set up\
your LLC as consulting I would say actually look at what it is you're trying to do the thing is is what a lot of people there's a lot of\
misinformation out there with the gurus and stuff that are telling people to do things to try to finesse the bank But\
it's like literally think about what you want to do business-wise and then go get\
funding Don't try to just get funding just for the sake of getting funding Yep If you want to get into real estate tell\
the bank that If you want to get into trucking tell the bank that If you want to you know don't tell them that you're\
doing credit repair if that's what you're trying to do That's the one thing too Yeah Don't tell them if you're trying to do credit repair whatever\
business industry you're trying to get into whether it's group homes you know cosmetics different things like that you can be honest with the bank about what\
you're trying to do And when you're applying you can give them an explanation of what your plan is and and\
that stuff that will be considered kind of in the underwriting process So I would typically say set up the LLC is\
what you want it to be Whatever your plan is for the business set the LLC up as that You can do if you are going to\
do real estate or trucking you want to do human resources consulting or some type of consulting then you can just say\
real estate consulting like property management or for transportation you can say something like I'm going to just do\
dispatching or something where your business isn't looked at as risky Um if\
you are somebody that just still wants to stick with that information of setting it up as consulting Um but you want to make sure that you have an\
address you want to make sure that you have an email you want to make sure that you have a telephone number Um so those are the parts where you want to make\
sure that you look good on paper because if you want to go and get big funny big funding or big money like the big\
businesses you want to look like the big businesses on paper But at the same time too if you're an LLC that's just\
starting out and it just looks like a shell of a company and it's like a virtual address and all these different\
things the bank's not going to give money to you You want to look like a legit business You want to know what you're talking about when you get on the\
phone with these banks and just have a story to tell If you have a story to tell then they're going to want to lend\
to you But when you are when you don't know what you're trying to do you're just trying to get money It's like uh well I think I'm going to get it Then\
you probably don't need to get funding You probably need to just sit on the sidelines Sit on the sidelines Sit on the sidelines What is the process\
Banking Relationships \
because we hear people talk a lot about you talked about structure but we hear people talk a lot about building relationships What does that process\
look like on the business side so on the business side you know and I'm going to give some game here too on how to build\
relationships but um you know as it relates to building relationships on the business side depending on the bank a\
lot of times what people don't realize is is if you're about to apply for a business credit card building a\
relationship is great right like in the short term your internal bank score is basically how the bank is ranking you\
based on your deposits based on how much money has come out different things like that If you look lendable um that if if\
you just start a business if you just open up a business bank account you just start a business in a shorter time frame\
you're going to look better by making smaller deposits or making larger deposits in a shorter time frame But if\
you've been with a bank for over two years and you haven't even had in\
that account and you're trying to tell them that you're making million a year they like where that million at\
because it ain't with us right like you need to go ask whoever it is that you got that give us some of that money and\
then we'll talk So as far as establishing relationships what a lot of people don't realize is is you know I\
would say kind of the to day time frame is what I would consider an ideal time frame Okay you know if we're really\
if we really want to get saucy and we're talking about you know trying to you know the people that talk about the \
days and the stuff like that things different things like that before you ask for more money what you can go and\
do is is if you're somebody that's in position to get business funding leverage your personal credit to go and\
get a personal loan Um and then you can go and deposit in an account in an account in an\
account And then sometimes they'll look at that and say "Well we can at least give them this because we know this is\
what was deposited in the account." So that was a major hack on how I was able to get a $business credit card\
with Chase when I only had a credit score at the time because they were going off of that relationship per se as\
opposed to it strictly being a credit thing So when it comes to them pulling your credit is going to be one of those\
scenarios where it's like there's multiple factors that are that are considered So sometimes you know you\
might not be in position creditwise you know but you may have a good relationship And that's even when you\
talk about revenue based lending that's how it works It's like okay this person is in position creditwise but they have\
the revenue to support why we should give them some money So hey business owners imagine being able to walk in and\
out of banks and starting to see approvals instead of rejections And it's not because you changed anything with your business but because you put your\
personal credit report in the position it needed to be in Here at Takeoff Financial our team helps business owners\
just like you using consumer law strategies that'll get real results in real time We remove collections charge\
offs late payments evictions delinquent student loans along with anything else that's keeping you from getting to your\
funding goals And best of all it's completely done for you We send the disputes file the complaints and do\
everything needed to help put you in position to access your first $to $in business credit So if you're\
interested head over to takeofffinancial.com or click the link in the description below to book a free consultation with me and my team to\
learn more about how we can help you get one step closer to your funding goals So we we build our relationship uh with\
these banks Now we we structure our business We build our relationship with these banks Now what does that process\
look like because one of the words I hear thrown around a lot or we we know it's thrown around a lot in the space is sequence Sequence sequence right knowing\
the right banks to go to understanding where these banks pull from to make sure that like once you do all this heavy lifting it doesn't matter if you're\
partnered or in relationship with three or five banks you go to this bank first and you go to this bank after you go to this bank after that What does that\
process now look like when we're trying to I guess identify okay which of these banks we're going to go what order of these banks we're going to go to for the\
funding Yeah So so a lot of people over complicate this Really literally the first foundational piece that you need\
to know about this is there's going to be usually for the most part depending on the bank there's going to be three\
three bureaus that these banks pull from Experian TransUnion Equifax A lot of\
times there will be some banks that may pull from your check systems There may be some banks that pull Lexus Nexus some\
of the secondary bureaus But for the most part most of these banks especially the tier one banks are just going to\
pull the big three the main three So as it relates to going and getting business funding whatever whatever bureaus are\
Business Funding Sequence: Which Banks, Which Order\
the best excuse me whatever bureaus are the best those are the ones that you want to identify as like okay these are\
I need to find banks that are going to check my score on Experian or check my score on TransUnion or check my score on\
Equifax So whenever you're setting up a sequence per se is what they saw is is what they call it It is it honestly is\
as simple as as you know doing your research on YouTube and different things like that to to find additional banks\
But we on the show so we got to give them some some to to go and do it So let's do it So there's a lot of stuff\
out there We got to go with the tier one stuff This is the other part too So I talked about the auto loan thing So it's\
really up to or about the personal loan thing So it's really up to you So I'm going to give two ways basically on on\
what banks you can go to but if you leverage what I talk about with the personal loan plays what I was able to do it doesn't matter what bank you go to\
you know is because a lot of times to they'll give you that based on what that is So um we'll start with TransUnion\
personal side We got we got like Navy Federal all of the Elan financial banks on the business side So what a lot of\
people don't know with Elan Financial Banks is there are a bunch of banks out there smaller banks who they don't have\
their own underwriting system So when you go on these banks websites you know Liberty um credit union one um there's a\
beris bank there's a bunch of banks where if you go to the website and you're about to apply for a business credit card and all of those websites\
look the same just with a different coloring Um those are usually Elan Financial Bank You can do something as\
simple as googling Elon Financial Banks Brooklyn or wherever you're located and\
then you'll see a list of banks and you can go and apply for those banks online and those are usually banks that you can\
apply for that pull TransUnion and and those credit unions are usually giving out anywhere from to per card\
So as far as exposure goes when I say exposure it means how much a bank will usually give out before they start\
asking for docks You can go usually up to with Elon Banks before\
they start asking for any kind of stuff And then with the time frame the longer you wait because this is a marathon not\
a sprint You can continue to go there So TransUnion those Elon Banks you can go and get there Easy Boom Done You\
can apply online for those because a lot for a lot of people applying through TransUnion is going to be easier Then we\
got Bank of America If you're leveraging the personal loan play then usually Bank of America will give you a high limit So\
a lot of people don't know I'm giving this out because we on the show but but a lot of my clients get the s the s\
the on a Bank of America business card where for most people they might only get maybe if\
they use a bankrupt But when we deposit those funds and then go apply right out the gate my people are getting those\
those higher limits because it's like dang like we got to at least give him what he's showing us he has So Bank of\
America's a great one Depending on where you're located Amex you know we love the blue cards I'm going to tell people to\
stay away from the charge cards the gold you know the platinum because a lot of those cards they're asking for you to\
it's it's based off the spinning power The algorithm is weird those cards they're usually going to ask for um\
they're they're usually going to ask that you pay that money back the same month Whereas when you do like the business card the the blue business\
incus plus um the blue cards there's two blue cards on Amex they'll usually\
extend you a limit So depending on where you're located they may pull Experian they may pull TransUnion Um usually the\
beautiful part is with a ax they have the pre-approval tool where you can go and in insert in insert input your\
information and they'll give you an offer before you have to accept it So there's no hard pull there So that's a major hack Um so moving over to Experian\
with TransUnion we also have US Bank as well They do a uh multiple credit cards anywhere from to but their\
line of credit is a soft pull on Equifax So we'll actually pivot to Equifax from there So Equifax we got Citizens They'll\
do a soft pool there They'll give you on a business credit card and on a business line of credit % interest on\
that one I mean you actually don't have to have a bank account with Citizens to do that one We got First Citizens as\
well They also will do something similar as well uh to where you can get a $credit card That one you do have\
to go and branch you know I would recommend having yourself together look nice you know just so that you don't\
even give them a reason to try to you know give you any trouble or anything like that Um I usually will will try to\
stay away from Equifax for the most part just because sometimes those inquiries are a little bit harder to remove But a\
lot of the credit unions that we talk about they all pull pull from pull from Equifax So you can leverage websites\
like I said like credit boards where people will post their approvals and show you okay um this is the the bank\
that I applied to and this is where they pulled from So you're able to to to kind of go and verify and check for the most\
recent up-to-date information before you go apply Now as we swing over to Experian we have obviously what's you\
know going viral right now is Chase So if you aren't in with Chase you need to go ahead and and go ahead and get get\
your money from Chase because they about to be shutting it down They're about to be tightening up actually come July st they're about to make be making some\
some changes where they're going to be geolocking people So basically if you don't know what that means if you're not in a certain area um you're not going to\
be able to do a docu sign with a bankrupt that's in California or um you're not going to be able to do a docu sign with a bankrupt that's in a\
different area that you're not in So basically what's happening right now is a lot of people are leveraging bank reps to push applications through Um so it's\
going to be important for if you're somebody that's in the space or trying to do this for yourself leveraging having a bank rep in your area so so\
that you can go and then go and get that high limit business credit card for yourself So Chase usually they will give\
out up to um in business credit cards Usually what we see people get on\
the first card is anywhere from to and then you can apply for a second card online that you can usually\
get like another to on Um that's usually what we're seeing people get I would say probably up to a hundred\
I would say the most Um but they give out up to before they start\
asking for stuff Um Navy Federal Old Faithful they pull Experian on the\
business side they usually will give up to or so Uh what I usually am seeing for people is they'll usually\
give out anywhere from like that that to k range They usually don't go too too high on that Um and then Amex as I\
said before AX will pull some of the some of the Experian some of the Experian stuff as well So this is the\
part too that I I want to add you know kind of as I wrap up this part you know if you're somebody that's that's going\
to go and get a lot of funding for yourself like you just love the game of of getting funding continuing to go and\
do those different things then you'll be someone that can do the research to do these things But from a business\
perspective what I've realized you know what has made us so successful in a short amount of time is we've been able\
to um you know dumb it down not having you know plays that we're trying\
to apply for for for you know multiple different people um and just having you know a couple banks that we do and just\
running those into the ground So I think Bruce Lee said something like you know I\
I fear not the man that that has done um kicks one time but the man who's done one kick times So you\
know that's how we've been able to to really scale and really you know grow our business because we've simplified\
things Once you start getting into just trying to have too too many banks then it's kind of one of those things where it's like you're just you're you're all\
over the place you know so it's good to kind of have those breadandbut plays that you run Um just because otherwise\
you can be spinning your wheels and and stuff trying to do that So that that was\
a very thorough break Probably one of the better breakdowns I think we've we've had on the show ever when you talk\
about funding sequences I'm curious to know they said cooking man I get why they say like I'm I'm cooking I'm over here burning up and stuff Burning up I'm\
over here burning up Here's my question though from your experience because once again not only are you doing a lot of\
have you done a lot of these things for yourself you're coaching people What have you seen are some of the biggest mistakes that most business owners are\
making when it comes to getting access to funding because information is there but people still are falling short of\
Top Mistakes People Make Seeking Funding\
they want to but they're only getting $approvals here $or $approvals there What have you\
seen from your end i I would say there there's a there's a couple of different things right you know it really depends on the person I think that haste makes\
waste So to the point you know of of the mindset is the most important part A lot of people are not really taking the time\
to build out that personal credit profile They're doing the bare minimum They're slapping a bunch of trade lines on and they're like "Oh I have a \
credit score Like how much can you give me?" And it's like "Okay well why don't we we go and add those credit builders\
go and add those primary accounts go and get those two high limit personal credit cards You know at least up to is\
what you want to have in personal credit cards that you own." Yeah And um let those see let those season let those sit\
for a couple months before you go apply It seems like for whatever reason and I don't know if this just a law of money a\
law of life but it seems like the people that are the thirstiest for the funding for whatever reason end up being the\
clients that that only get or And then the people that are like "Oh I only need like " They get\
on the card So and that just goes to show kind of more of a personality perspective of like those people have\
taken the time to build out their credit and they're they're not necessarily in a position to where they're like desperate\
for the funding And that's something that the banks usually can sense as well whenever you're talking to underwriters and different things like that But if\
you're somebody that's that's oh I need to get this like in your just your haste your your energy is chaotic you don't\
have an idea of what you actually want to do with the money they can sense that because a lot of this stuff and that's\
the beautiful part about using the relationship managers you can they can have a a live conversation with the\
underwriters of like this is why this person is looking for this yeah you know what can we do for this person and\
different things like that so that's one of the the main things I would say is the personal profile the second thing I\
would say is a lot of people are are just getting the door slammed shut in their face due to the address thing Um a\
lot of people are not putting themselves in position because they set up an LLCS consulting or general consulting and\
then they have a a virtual address or something like that and that's something that's been a live in-game change And\
that's why I say it's so important to be honest about what you're trying to do and setting up a home address instead of\
that address because whenever it's time to apply you're just another consulting business that's that's using the exact\
same numbers that everybody else is that that everybody else is using But if you actually take some time to go on chat\
GBT think about what business you want to run and okay how much money am I\
actually projecting that this business will make then they can actually extend you credit based on those numbers and\
that story that you're able to tell as opposed to just using the same numbers and then you know having a generic\
response I'm a consulting business that focuses on blah blah blah blah blah blah blah So let let's talk a little bit now\
about we talked a lot of credit but now let's talk about something you've helped hundreds of people do which is turning\
that credit to cash flow right monetizing this knowledge you've been successful in building a a very\
lucrative credit and funding business and you're helping other people do the same If I'm watching this let's start\
Why Credit & Funding Is the Easiest Business to Start\
off with the why Why should I even consider starting a business around credit and funding taking this information that that you just gave me\
this blueprint that you just gave me not just funding myself but potentially helping other people get funded so I can create a business that's putting more\
money in my pocket Man let me let me let me say this too because because I was on here and I said this and I saw like two\
or three other people say it Okay So it's like I know I know I know where the sauce is coming from It's like okay I'm\
starting to see the influence and the impact and I love it Okay In \
there is not a easier business model to get into than starting a credit and funding business When we talk about the\
concept of getting into business we want to pursue things that are are we have to think about different things like you\
know what's seasonal what are things that change you know credit repair as it relates to you know or even funding You\
have to stay up to date because there will be nuances and changes in the industry But fitness credit repair I\
would even say beauty or things that involve you know selling to women are going to be recession proof So from a\
perspective of if you're wanting to p if you're wanting to pursue something where you can have kind of that compound\
interest of where you can stack your skills and stack your information over time credit repair and funding is a\
great industry because over time you can continue to just gather information and learn more um to\
where you can look up and you have all this experience that allows you to build a profitable business Not only that if\
you're somebody that's watching this and you work a tocredit repair as far as\
the fulfillment goes and as or even funding as far as the fulfillment goes it doesn't take a lot of time So if\
you're somebody that's watching this and you're like "Okay I'm working a toI want to make an extra to a month." Then you need to start a credit\
repair and funding company because not only is it recession proof there is a thirsting\
neverending demand for people that are messing their credit up And then now we're talking about okay if I'm working\
a job or um you know if I'm doing something else or if I run a business whether you're in real estate whatever\
it might be you can leverage whatever business that is to just network with other people and ask them like "What's\
your credit like do you need more if you know other business owners do you need funding for your business?" So it's a\
business not only that you can do as your primary business but if you're in another industry it's something that you\
can add as a service to what it is that you already offer M so what's the first step that we need to take if we're\
starting we have the knowledge but we don't have the business if we're starting from ground zero with the business we got the LLC we got the\
funding everything else but how can we what's the first step we need to take now turning this this credit information\
that we have into a cash flowing funding and credit business okay so so first thing I would say is if you have\
everything you need to make sure that you have a way to collect payments so assuming that a person doesn't have that go ahead and find something you know\
find a way for you to be able to collect payments so you know when we're starting out CTC is my motto I tell my sales reps\
you know collect the cash So when you're when you're networking when you're talking to people cash apps zale\
whatever you got to do to collect the cash to to to fulfill on your service then you you do that But obviously you want to get to a point to where you're\
collecting payments like a legitimate business But I would say first things first we all have one of these I have\
like four of them but um we all have a cell phone go on that cell phone go post on Facebook and say "Yo I was able to\
successfully clean my credit from the low s to the high whatever it might be." Post some screenshots of a testimonial and say\
"If you're interested let me know." And people will reach out to you and then you can begin to have a conversation with them to to turn them into a paying\
client I would usually say and this is just me being honest the people that join my program and the people that are in my program making an extra to\
a month running a credit repair and funding company is a very practical thing And that's why I've been able to\
have success in such a short amount of time And that's why the people that are in my program are killing it because I have people who come into contact with\
me working a -doing whatever it is that they do and they're like "It's only\
been days and I've already made " And it's like yes because you have people that know like and trust you as a person So now that you're offering\
that service they're going to be prone to working with you and giving it giving it a try rather than working with some\
random guy that they may have seen on seen online with no social proof So I would say your your warm market is going\
to be first step of you making your first to But then we also have some organic ways as well that we we we\
show our our mentees how to get clients I mean I mean you got to you got to you got to drop at least one You got to drop we got we got we got we got a little\
time What what are some of the organic ways okay so I'm going to hit I'm going to touch on the Eventbrite play right quick because I saw somebody else drop\
it on here and that's something that that I teach but I'm going to give some other ones that weren't on here cuz man\
you got one of the best shows bro One of the best audiences man So we got to show love every time we come on here We're not doing no gatekeeping So first things\
first you can go on Eventbrite There's a there's something that people do You can go and either set up a listing say free\
business funding or free credit repair event Um and you can set it as a virtual event So people that are all over\
searching on Eventbrite there's some people that don't use Instagram There's some people that don't use different social media platforms or even Google to\
find things There are people local people that just use Eventbrite you know or or whatever resources they're\
accustomed to using So you can set up a free virtual event on Eventbrite Free credit repair free funding to where you\
can have hundreds sometimes even thousands I've had a thousand people sign up for a virtual event on Eventbrite Basically where I said I'm\
going to show you how to do X Y and Z all this stuff And then I just hosted a free webinar basically through Eventbrite where I had all these people\
come and just sit with me for minutes give out a little bit of game and then you can make an offer That's a way that\
you can get clients on Eventbrite Take it a step further with the Eventbrite play You can search business chapter you\
can search um women business network or anything business in Eventbrite filter it to your area and then you have all\
these business owners that are having conferences and you can reach out and say "Hey can I come tell can I come\
offer business funding services?" And because a lot of these times these are local meetups these are they're these\
are weekly bi-weekly sometimes even monthly meetups that these different business groups and different things\
like that are having Yeah And they will they'll respond because it's the organizer of the event is letting you\
reach out to them So you're going straight to the source and it allows you to have a conversation with this person who will then allow you to come to come\
offer your services to their people But we on a Marvin Prince show so we gota we got to go This is the way that I was\
able to get somebody a million dollars in funding The most funding that I've ever gotten somebody was a million\
dollars in funding It was a combination of some business credit cards different things like that but mainly SBA stuff\
and some lines of credit and term loans Every state city usually has like a\
chamber of commerce So they have some sort of business meetup that's put on by the city You can either just be uh a\
member of it There's an association fee or you can come as a guest a couple times They'll let you come If you go to\
these local meetups if you go you're in the room with business owners that that run largely successful businesses\
There's so many businesses out there donut shops coffee shops local businesses is in your area that are\
making insane revenue but they're just not franchise So you think that okay it's not it's not everywhere so they\
might not be doing that great but they're making great money They're that mom and pop shop that's been there for years They're they're they're there\
for a reason for that amount of time So you can go to these chamber of commerce meetings and meet up with people shake\
hands in the network and the mixers and stuff I was able to go into a chamber of commerce in Dallas and be able to meet\
multiple business owners and that was honestly one of our best months where we were able to just network and shake\
hands with those people where you're able to find clients who are able to have business revenue and you can go and\
get them You know those are some of the easiest clients to fund and that's just on the organic right so as we start to\
build a sustainable business then you can start to attract and pay for people to come to you as far as like paid\
traffic different things like that But those are just some of the organic ways I could I I could keep going all day\
I I've that's my first time hearing about that You said is the chamber say it again The chamber of commerce Hey I\
know I'm going after this Chamber of Commerce People were loving the instant data scraper gym that I gave last time but but the chamber of commerce is is is\
a great one to do as well Okay Okay So we have the foundation of understanding\
how to get pe how to get people in the door whether it's just getting in contact with people on Facebook and\
Instagram that know us personally we already have them like trust with us or going a step further of whether you're talking about the Eventbrite strategy\
the chamber of commerce strategy chamber of commerce strategy and beyond What's interesting is\
there going to be a percentage of individuals that take the information run it and start making money right from their credit and funding And around the\
same time as I'm seeing now and as I'm as you're seeing now in them running this business they in anyone that's in\
the entrepreneurial space we hear a lot of talk about multiple streams of income right they say when you have one income\
source of income it's too close to none You need at least seven The average millionaire has seven And I think a lot\
of people are going to hear this information and hear that information and say "Okay cool I just made I'm now making X amount of my credit Now if I\
need multiple streams I got to go run this business and then I got to open an e-commerce store Then after that I got\
to go open this start this trucking business I got then I got to get in real estate I got to start a crypto business." You and I know that that's\
not the name to the game that individuals should be following when it comes to this adage of multiple streams\
of income How are you coaching individuals around how they can take this business model and make multiple\
streams of income from it man I I can't I it it sounds so crazy to say but I I honestly can't believe that that that\
people are still broke in because I feel like we're in a day and age where it's it hasn't been easier to make an\
extra or a month There are so many people that are so distracted with the the multiple streams of income lies\
and some of these myths out here that you don't even have to be like taking insane action You could literally just\
be walking in the right direction You're going to make it a lot farther than people that are going in the wrong direction So the multiple streams of\
income thing is is is a big myth But whenever I meet whenever I meet mentees or when people come to my program one of\
the main things I tell them is look you want to start a funding business That's great But at the end of the day there's\
going to be more people that want funding that don't qualify than there are going to be people that just come to\
you that are qualified That's just the reality of what it is I mean it's it's you're going to have more leads than you\
actually have clients That's that's what it is a lot of times That's just how leads work Yeah So why not get paid for\
your time to where So so that's two streams of income right there It's like okay you have the inbound traffic or however you're getting clients where\
it's like okay you're interested in getting funding but you don't qualify So now we can sell you a credit repair\
service where we can help you repair your credit So we can sell you a credit repair service Oh okay You don't have an\
LLC We have a consulting service where we can help you set up an LLC Okay that's a third stream of income Okay\
cool We've started to build your credit out we've started to build your credit out or or you haven't built your credit\
out Now we are affiliates with Self Kickoff Rent Reporters Boom Pay Ava all these different credit builder accounts\
where now you can build your credit out So it's like not only am I helping you I'm getting a kickback for helping these people out So that's another stream of\
income I don't know what number we're on now but cuz they they want seven streams but we're just going to keep rocking Okay you need trade lines Okay cool You\
can go on trade line supply You can go on different places where you can become a vendor and you can go and resell these\
trade lines and you can resell them and make a profit and still undercut the market because there's people charging\
an arm and leg for these trade lines but you can go and get them at wholesale and then just resell them So as far as the\
multiple streams I would say you know it's a a big misconception Those are a lot of ways that you can do it Um but\
really the main thing is like for just an extra $to$a month you can leverage just a personal loan play like\
a pre-approval like credible.com or you can just sell trade lines or you can just take on credit repair clients But\
you should be able to successfully easily make an extra toa month even to a month with just one\
stream M a lot of times we get caught in like trying to have all these streams of\
income but it's like the main stream is not even good enough Stream ain't streaming The stream ain't streaming and\
you trying to go do other different things And it's like the thing that's the reason why the one isn't work the\
one isn't working because a lot of times you are competing with somebody that's only doing that one thing and you think\
that you're gonna beat them by doing different things and they've been doing that one thing perfecting\
that one that one kick non-stop every day all day is all they do by the time you get back to trying that we said\
kicks by the time you get back to trying that that kick they've done of those kicks so it's just like\
you know I get on my soap box about that brother it's I'm I'm I'm right there with you I'm right there with you So so\
then I'm curious to know from your experience right because we talk about the mistake that business owners make\
when it comes to this multiple streams of income I want to kind of flip it and talk about some of the right decisions\
that business own these business owners need to be making in this business From your personal experience and from the\
people that you've coached what are the three most important decisions that most\
business owners can make that will help them get to their first six figures that can help them get to their first six figures Man that's that that's a great\
one I would say the the main thing that you know and this is something that I talk with my lady about a lot lately mistake that business owners are making\
or things that they can do Um every time I look up and I'm like man\
the where why has there been a decline in revenue what is what is going on why was there a drop off what might have\
been the times where I was making the most money I was only focusing on like maybe one or two funding plays maybe\
sometimes even three or a very simple sequence And it's like okay we tried to leverage getting this person the funding\
and it didn't work Maybe there's some more work that you need to do or or maybe just letting them know like hey\
this is where it ends for us Because because if you're somebody that's that's working in the business which is what\
the second thing I will say is like if you're somebody that's working in the business and you're trying to do all these different plays or trying to do\
all these different banks for a person you might not be able to really grow\
because you're you're getting stuck on this this one thing while other people are just moving fast Like the guy that's\
that's that's only doing the chase play and he's like just just just smacking chase It's like okay yeah he might that\
that well might run dry at some point but the thing is is you got to realize it's like he may have made over six\
seven figures from just running that one play while you're trying to to to do a bunch of different plays So I would say\
focusing on like one channel maybe a few if you have um as it relates to getting people business funding as far as the\
credit repair and funding business goes The second thing I would say is working in the business and not on the business\
There's a lot of entrepreneurs and even I found myself it's like you know it's so crazy and now that I'm on the other\
side of the table when I was making a lot less money I was working a lot harder and now we're making way more\
money and I'm not working as hard and I feel guilty at times saying this but it's like you hire people that are\
better than you to do the things that you don't like to do Facts So why not why like that sounds so crazy Why why am\
I doing the things in my business that I don't like to do especially if those things are things that aren't making the\
business money So even for myself it reached a point to where me taking calls or me doing customer service was losing\
us money So we started to outsource and we started to hire people There's gyms\
You can go on places like online jobs.ph and you can find people in other countries where you can hire them for a\
fraction of the cost of what it would cost you to hire somebody here in the US And that will allow you to to find\
somebody that's going to work hard they're going to be grateful and they're going to be and you're you're helping them because the conversion rate here\
like our dollars go a lot further than than what the exchange rate is there So outsourcing is is the second thing I\
would say that really will allow a person to go to that six even seven figures because a lot of times it's like\
okay if you're if like I said if you're working in the business and you're doing customer service or you're doing you\
know onboarding those are things that aren't going to bring in income but they're necessary essential parts of\
running the business I would say Um the third thing I would say is most people\
most people they are not spending enough money on their business Come on They are not spending enough money on their\
business And a lot of people get caught in this rabbit hole of like I'm investing in in myself But what they\
don't realize is like you really aren't investing enough into yourself Like they get caught in like in like this rabbit\
hole of maybe getting more information I don't know logos whatever it might be But it's like you have to pay for\
eyeballs The way that's going to what's going to help you make more money is eyeballs because money follows attention\
It's not the person that people\
focus on being the best and having everything just so so together it seems like the money's going down versus\
whenever versus whenever we were just like we're just going to let it rip you know we're just going to let the rocket boosters rip and we're just going to let\
as many people come in and we're going to do our best But at the end of the day that's just what it is It's like when you think about Netflix these big\
corporations it's like a dumpster fire you know but but they're making so much\
money So I think a lot of people are just not spending enough on their business It's like they might spend you\
know or they might spend on some ads and they think like I should be a millionaire I'm investing in myself\
Yeah I should be a millionaire I'm investing in myself It's almost one of those things with what I've realized with the way money has worked for me Um\
obviously sometimes you you expect to get you know a to x on whatever it is you spend but for me in my business with\
being online with ads different things like that it's like if you want to make a certain amount of money you have to\
almost be willing to spend half of that amount of money So it's like a lot of times when what people aren't telling\
people online it's like okay yes they made a million dollars but they may have spent With this business model\
luckily we're in an industry in a space where you don't have to you know there's really no overhead essentially So you\
know you're not having to pay for a bunch of like you know warehouses or anything like that But spending money on\
eyeballs I guarantee you if you're watching this and you're running a credit repair and funding business you are not spending enough on your business\
just because now that I'm in this there's a lot of money getting spent And even with my mentors with people I see\
that are at higher levels in other industries or in this industry they are spending that bag Yeah like they are\
spending it like spending it and I would say for me that's kind of been one of the shifts is like sometimes to go to\
another level in your business you may have to spend something that's out of your comfort zone a lot of times not knowing if it's going to come back or\
when it's going to come back rather so so you know sometimes to really get out of survival mode in your business or\
hiring somebody you know you might only be making or $a month $\
a month But to hire an A player on your team it may cost you you know $a\
month or half of that revenue But now you're going to have so much more time\
to to go and get more money And not only that sometimes too these people that you hire they bring insight coming from\
other companies and stuff that can help you guys make more money This is good bro This is this is this is\
very very good What's interesting to hear hear you talk the way that you're talking is this is your second time on\
the show and the first time you were here last year you were one foot in I\
don't want to say one foot and one foot out but you were running a successful business while you were still at your -Fast forward now you're full-time\
When to Quit Your \'96\
into entrepreneurship So you've been on all three sides of the of this if you\
will to where you've been at a point in your life where you were strictly just and that's it You've been in a point\
where you're half nineto-and I'm also running my business you know from five to nine And now you're at a point where\
you are full-time into entrepreneurship And I say that because we have a lot of\
people who may be watching this episode right now who are in one of those three buckets probably in one of the first two\
where they are either all in on their -and they're thinking about starting a business or they're still in their -\
but they just started their business and they're trying to get it from the ground up A lot of them see me see you and they're\
like "Man I'm just nine to five I'm I'm gonna I know my business isn't where it needs to be yet but I'm I'm gonna just\
go all in on business right now." What are what are the conversations that that you have with maybe some students that\
of yours that are coming into your program who may be in a similar situation like those people when it\
comes to making that decision given that you know it's a decision you've had to make it's a decision I've had to make in terms of what that process should look\
like man So so I'll say I'll say this and this is something that I tell my students all the time you know and there's some heavy hitters in this space\
Y'all have heavy hitters on here all the time You're a heavy hitter I don't think that there's anybody I would argue that\
made seven figures in credit repair and funding faster than I did Um and I say\
that because of my willingness to not let go of my -Uh because for a lot of\
people myself included what I tell people is like the reason why I was able to move so fast is because my -was my\
first employee M So while I was working a -any money that was made from the\
credit repair any money that was made from the funding I was able to reinvest that money and not have to to worry\
about you know still needing that money to live off of Now being on the other side of the table absolute blessing I\
live in a penthouse now I've been able to buy a Lamborghini in the last couple of months but making those sacrifices\
early to really grow and build a sustainable business is what allowed me\
to grow super fast And I tell people all the time it's like okay if you're not making the type of money to I would say\
at least two or x what you're making at your job monthly then it might not be worth leaving your -because you might\
just be what a lot of people don't realize trading a job for another job or\
another lower paying job and running a business So you know a lot of the education that I give people and I've\
even left my -and had to go back to the toSo that's the people that that's the thing that people don't\
realize is like super super blessing to be on this side of the table It's not easy Um you are having to use your mind\
You know you're having to figure things out There's fires every day Every day\
Every day You know um and you know I didn't work n I didn't want to work a toand now I work /So you know if\
it's something that you really want to do and you feel that calling um then I definitely would say that you know set\
that goal What I what I ended up doing actually for myself and it's so funny I don't even know if it's still on my\
phone but um I get a notification every day um that used to say like "Leave\
AT&T." And so I set that I set that calendar invite or I set that reminder in my calendar Um and I still get that\
to this day But set a date you know set a date in the future if that's something that you want to do But I would not\
recommend anyone in my program is what I tell them I would not recommend leaving your nineto-until you at least have\
you know a nest egg saved up And not only that till you have some funding\
because as it relates to your business you have to spend money to make money is what a lot of people don't realize Going back to what we were just talking about\
you have you're going to have to be willing to spend money to make money And\
wealth is such a spiritual principle that the it for whatever reasons like the more you spend the more you make But\
you're you're going to have to be able to spend money Yep And if you're not in a position right now where your business is not making enough money to where you\
can spend and you're not ready to take those risks then you know the -may be for you But for\
me you know none of my co-workers were driving a Lamborghini Um so you know I've been able to leave my nineto-and\
and and you know be in a position where I'm fortunate but you gotta drop those nuts Got to drop\
those nuts You have to make decisions you know as a business owner as an entrepreneur that that are tough\
decisions you know whereas with working a -you can get off working You have that security It's like you know there's\
times where it's like dang I want to hang out and watch Netflix with my lady\
you know but I still have stuff to do So it's like okay those are trade-offs you have to make It's like no we can't we\
can't we're not going out to eat right now We're locked in Or okay I stayed up and now we're watching movies but now I\
can't go to bed cuz I have to fix whatever this thing is you know so I definitely would say continue to stay\
locked in on your -Let it be your first employee because that's what I was able to do And you know I talk about\
being able to make so much money in the first place but there's so many frameworks that I got from working a -\
So many habits so many ways that I saw how things were run and working for a a billion-dollar corporation that I've\
been able to now apply to what it is that I'm doing now Attention business owners Are you tired of getting denied\

apply lenders hit you with the same brick wall time after time again your credit report You see here at Take All\

start getting funded head over to takeofffinancial.com to book a free consultation with me and my team to see\
how we can put you in position to get one step closer to your funding goals M at this point in your journey what would\
you as we start to kind of close things out what would you say is your northstar\
like you're at a point now like you said where you got the car the money and all these other different things What are\
you chasing right now in business i would say I would say like the the thing for me is is\
prior to this year there was a lot of there was a lot of time where it was like I was making money but I wasn't\
like really really tracking things Um so now I have like revenue goals and stuff\
that I plan on hitting But I had an interesting conversation with a good friend of mine in January and he's like\
"How much money um do you want to make this year?" You know and I was like "Uh you know I I really feel like we should\
finish at three or four million I would really have to mess some things up you know to make three or four if if we don't make three or four million this\
year." And he was like "Okay well how are you going to get there?" Mhm And so I think like for me kind of talking\
about you know what you're saying as far as Northstar like right now a lot of my focus is like really like getting into\
the weeds of like forecasting how much are we spending how much are we making how do we you know what direction are we\
going to go in different things like that but I would say for me I have this goal of of you know earning anywhere\
from you know like one and a half to million a month you know and that's a number that I that I place on it but for\
For me in the short term a lot of my goals are just getting to the point to where I can really just really help my\
family out You know the the same goals that I had when making it to the NFL you know buy mom a house buy grandma a house\
Those are things that I really want to do Um but I want to be able to do them respons responsibly in a way where you\
know I'm I have enough money to give them the down payment but I want to be able to say like no like y'all don't even have to worry about this at all\
Like this is the house Like y'all are put up You know y'all do what y'all just y'all just live here you know it's so\
I would say million a year would be like where I actually see myself in the next like to years Um you know\
billionaire bays billionaires So I I I I want I want to be you know but but a lot\
of that has to do more so with the impact that I want to make because a lot of those multi-billion dollar corporations they employ so many people\
So that's really the part that I've loved about this so much is like how much I make is directly tied and related\
to the amount of people that I get to impact And that's just something that like matters to me way more than the\
money I get texts every day from the people in my program about how just their minds have been open to this whole\
new world of you know being able to make extra money you know monthly and and not have to stress about bills and different\
things like that So all of that you know far exceeds making the money Mhm Um but\
you know we are so blessed to be in an industry where you know the more we make the more people we impact So man it's\

Credit Hacks to Increase Your Score FAST in \
these are the top five fastest ways to\
skyrocket your credit score in \
there are two types of people in \
those with high credit scores who get\
approved instantly lock in the lowest\
interest rates and get VIP treatment\
from banks and those who get denied\
stuck with high interest or worse\
completely ignored but here's the good\
news by the end of this video you're\
going to know the top five fastest ways\
to skyrocket your credit score in \
using new strategies that barely anyone\
is talking about and number one it's a\
cheat code the wealthy have used for\
years but no one teaches it in school so\
stay locked in because skipping just one\
of these can cost you hundreds of points\
and thousands of dollars so let's start\
from the bottom and work our way to the\
single most powerful credit hack of the\
year countdown begins now starting with\
number five but before I get into this\
list I want you to understand that\
you're getting this information from\
someone that has over credit cards so\
you don't have to and I have over an \
credit score so all of this information\
I'm going to give you has been tried\
truded and tested by me personally and\
by thousands of my clients that are now\
officially in the Club so jumping\
Credit Hack \
into number five pay down your credit\
cards to zero and keep them there most\
people understand that credit\
utilization is important because credit\
utilization is the balances that are\
reported from your credit cards and it\
makes up over % of your credit score\
but they don't know this the fastest way\
to see a score spike is to pay your\
credit cards down to zero and leave them\
there before the statement closing date\
and not just once consistently every\
single month and here's the big common\
mistake that everyone needs to avoid\
paying after the statement date the\
balance gets reported to the bureaus and\
it drags your credit score down and even\
worse you're paying outrageous interest\
fees on that specific balance that just\
reported do not listen to any of these\
amateurs out there that are telling you\
"No you have to report a balance because\
then it's not going to show that you're\
using your credit card that's absolutely\
a lie." And the next time you see\
someone post a video like that just be\
so kind and ask them in the comments\
"Hey could you do me a favor and show me\
exactly what your credit score looks\
like?" Let's put up mine so everyone can\
see it right now i'm an with Equifax\
an with TransUnion and an with\
Experian you can't tell me nothing now\
Credit Hack \
moving on to number four add a secured\
loan and pay off % after it hits your\
credit report and this is exactly why I\
tell everyone you need to bank with a\
major credit union stop banking with\
these banks that don't give a damn about\
you like Bank of America Wells Fargo and\
Chase Bank they don't even offer a\
secured loan option because they don't\
want you to know how you can easily\
increase your credit score if not every\
bank would be promoting it right because\
remember these banks make more money off\
of people with bad credit scores because\
they can charge them outrageous interest\
rates they don't make money off of\
people like me they hate people like me\
but the secured loan move is so\
underrated because it's a credit\
building secret weapon so these next\
four steps pay attention to and apply\
them immediately as soon as you possibly\
can step one open a secured personal\
loan with a term of at least months\
even longer is even better step two wait\
for it to post to your credit report not\
before step three then once it posts to\
your credit reports you're going to pay\
off % of the loan balance in one lump\
sum payment you'll probably have to call\
them over the phone and say "Hey I would\
like to pay off % of this loan i just\
saw it posted to my credit report."\
You're going to say "Great let's do\
that." And step number four put the\
remaining % on auto payment for the\
next months or however much is left\
on the loan but why does this work\
because it boosts your credit mix and\
builds a perfect payment history with\
almost no debt being carried it looks\
amazing to lenders and credit models but\
remember the longer the loan term the\
better months is the minimum don't do\
months don't do months it will hurt\
your credit but or months gets\
even more mileage okay we're going to\
repeat this again because it's very\
important don't pay off % too early\
you want that trade line to hit your\
credit report first otherwise it won't\
show the full balance or credit activity\
we want the banks and the lenders and\
the credit scoring algorithms to see\
that you just paid off % of this loan\
and they're going to love it and the\
common mistake to stay away from is that\
you are paying off the loan or closing\
it too early you lose the monthly score\
building activity you're trying to\
create so don't make that mistake i want\
to give a special shout out to all my\
Beasters out there that are working hard\
to fix their credit using Dispute Beast\
the most advanced AI credit repair\
software ever created that comes with a\
% money back guarantee but\
specifically to Louise Luis's credit\
score went up \
points after just one round with Dispute\
Beast and Jensie Jensen's credit score\
went up points after just one round\
with Dispute Beast but let's not forget\
James james' credit score went up \
points after just one round with Dispute\
Bees dispute Bee's link is going to be\
in the video description and pinned at\
the top of the comments for anyone that\
needs to fix their credit now moving on\
Credit Hack \
to number three adding an installment\
loan like Coovo that is a -month term\
and there's absolutely no hard inquiry\
because this is the smallest most\
powerful loan you'll ever take kovo is a\
digital credit builder that adds an\
installment trade line to your reports\
without a hard inquiry it reports\
monthly it's instant approval only takes\
minutes to set up and there is % APR\
and no fees i believe that there's\
absolutely no credit builders out there\
that charge you zero fees and zero APR\
like Coo does it's the only one of its\
kind here's your pro tip you're not\
doing this to borrow money you're doing\
this to add an ontime payment history\
stream that feeds your score growth\
every single month because KO will never\
report you late this is why I don't\
promote a lot of these other credit\
builders because guess what if you're\
late they'll report you late ko will not\
and Koo reports to all three credit\
reporting agencies and a bonus so\
they're going to report to Experian\
Equifax TransUnion and Inovvis and it's\
also going to give you the ability to\
track your FICO credit score which is\
tremendous because we want to track our\
FICO scores to see exactly where our\
score is trending to now here's the\
biggest mistake to avoid if you're going\
to do any credit builder you should\
never ever miss a payment and I\
understand people go through tough times\
and things can change overnight\
instantaneously so I understand what's\
going on but you have to understand if\
you commit to this commit to it and know\
that you have the money already set\
aside to go through the whole entire\
path to get your credit score to where\
it needs to be because jumping into a\
credit builder and then stopping it\
being late and then you pretty much\
wasted your money so let's not do that\
now if you feel that you're getting\
value from this so far smash that like\
button and drop a comment with the word\
score if you're ready to level up your\
credit score in so let's keep this\
Credit Hack \
going now moving on to number two report\
your rent with Boom and they will never\
report late payments ever this might be\
one of the most underrated credit hacks\
in the game and I'm going to be honest\
with you a lot of people are very\
fearful of using rent reporting programs\
or systems whatever you want to call\
them because they think that they're\
going to get reported late and in fact I\
would say more than % of them will\
report you late but Boom Report does not\
and Boom Report reports to all three\
credit reporting agencies so remember\
with Boom Report you can report your\
monthly rent payments to all three\
credit bureaus and the best part they\
will never report you late that means if\
you miss a payment your credit report\
still looks flawless and rent is likely\
your biggest monthly bill so why not use\
it to build credit now once you sign up\
for Boom Report you want to make sure\
that you avoid this mistake at all costs\
make sure your lease and landlord are\
verified because Boom makes it easy but\
don't skip those steps now there are two\
different options that you can choose\
from with Boom boom Report is going to\
charge you $annually or $per month\
for ongoing rent reporting which is\
going to be fantastic that's the very\
easy and basic process but here's where\
the kicker comes in if you've been\
living at the same rental property for\
more than years you want that previous\
positive payment history so for a\
onetime $payment Boom will report up\
to months of previous payment history\
that is serious impact and it's\
instantly injected into your credit\
profile which is going to boost your\
credit score link is going to be in the\
video description for any of these\
things that we talk about today and\
pinned at the very top of the comments\
for anybody that needs them now again be\
aware there is absolutely no hard\
inquiry to use Boom or to apply for or\
whatever there's no hard inquiry and it\
works with almost all types of rent\
payments so Boom can report rent\
payments made via Zel Venmo Cash App AC\
Check and more as long as it can be\
traced to your bank account so be aware\
of that last part's the most important\
now for the moment you've all been\
waiting for number one add yourself as\
Credit Hack \
an authorized user the right way this\
one is legendary when done correctly now\
you want to be added to a credit card\
with over years of perfect payment\
history years even better years is\
even crazier and you want over $\
credit limits on those credit cards the\
higher the better the bigger boost in\
your credit score you're going to see\
but also be aware that the credit card\
cannot have no lates and no balances\
carried because if it's carrying a\
balance it's going to affect your credit\
score if it has a late payment it's also\
going to affect your credit score with\
this single move you'll instantly\
inherit that payment history and your\
credit age and utilization will\
transform overnight but here's the catch\
don't use American Express they only\
report from the date you're added not\
the past history and that's where all\
the valuable information comes from so\
unfortunately American Express is the\
only one that does this every other\
credit card company it's a green light\
think about this right here these \
credit cards can change people's\
lives overnight as the famous Daniel\
Pena said "Show me your friends and I'll\
show you your future." When you're\
standing around in a circle of your \
friends look around and ask the question\
which six of these have bad credit and\
which four of these have good credit\
because those friends that have good\
credit could single-handedly help change\
your life or your relatives or your\
co-workers this is why it's important to\
talk about finances with your friends i\
know a lot of people don't like to do it\
but guess what there's always an uncle\
in the family like me that has good\
credit that can help change your life so\
maybe it's time that you talk to that\
uncle or that friend about your\
financial future now understand\
something also you are not responsible\
for that credit card or the primaries\
credit card you are only responsible for\
the charges that are made on your\
authorized user credit card be aware of\
that a lot of people have this\
misconception that you're liable for all\
of the purchases no you're not only for\
your authorized user credit card now\
here's the biggest common mistake that\
you need to avoid getting added to a new\
card or one with high utilization that\
can backfire very fast and destroy your\
credit profile let me be real with you\
your credit score is either a tool or a\
trap it opens doors to homes cars\
business funding or locks you in a life\
of highinterest payments and missed\
opportunities so which life are you\
choosing because if you start applying\
these five strategies today you could\
literally see a point increase in\
the next or days depending on\
when you get started and make sure to\
drop the word boost in the comments if\
you're going to apply at least one of\
these this week\'a0\
Freeze LexisNexis And These Credit Bureaus To Get MORE REMOVALS!!\'a0\
this is going to explain the difference\
between freezing versus opting out and\
some key points to remember now a freeze\
refers to placing a security lock on\
your report at a particular Bureau or a\
data Furniture this freeze prevents\
anyone from accessing your personal\
information without your specific\
authorization while opting out of a data\
Furniture means requesting that specific\
company to stop sharing your personal\
information with other entities\
effectively it removes your data from\
their database and it allows you to\
control who can share this information\
as well as where this information can be\
stored so the key points to remember a\
freeze will apply to your report at a\
bureau or a data Furniture this prevents\
the authorization to access that\
information whereas opting out actually\
applies to specific data Brokers that\
store your information and this does not\
enable them to share your information\
with other places so I've seen a lot of\
How This Helps\
conflicting information as to if opting\
out or freezing actually does help you\
get information removed for me in my own\
personal opinion I think yes opting out\
and freezing information with data\
furnishers or bureaus is something you\
definitely want to do now it can help\
you by limiting the amount of personal\
financial information that's shared\
that's very important you want to make\
make sure that you reduce the amount of\
information that's given to all these\
companies freely the only way that you\
can really do that is by freezing and\
opting out which can potentially reduce\
the number of unsolicited credit card\
offers and marketing materials that you\
receive on a daily basis now this will\
effectively protect your privacy and of\
course reduce spam reduce unwanted calls\
reduce unwanted mail things like that so\
to put it simply when you opt out you\
are essentially telling companies that\
provide your information like Banks like\
credit card issuers to not share your\
data with anybody else for marketing\
purposes that is a huge benefit you\
always want to do that now when it comes\
to freezing freezing is not a complete\
block a security freeze does not apply\
to companies or collection agencies\
acting on behalf of such companies with\
which you have an existing account so\
they're still able to request\
information in regards to your consumer\
report for the purpose of reviewing or\
collecting account information or\
collecting a balance on that account so\
List of Consumer Reporting Companies\
now that we understand the situations\
that would require us to opt out freeze\
or to even remove this information let's\
talk about the list of consumer\
reporting agencies I want you to know\
every single place that has your\
personal information how you can find it\
and what you can do to either opt out\
freeze or remove that information\
CFPB List\
currently we're looking at a list of\
consumer reporting companies and this is\
on the cfpb website as of it has\
been updated and I'm going to link this\
in the description below I want you to\
have access to this this is a PDF that\
you can download and at the table of\
contents the introduction section lets\
you know who can see your Consumer\
Reports you can click on that it'll jump\
right down to that section so it lets\
you know consumer reporting companies\
must follow legal restrictions but\
generally provide consumer reports and\
risk scores to an array of businesses\
including and it goes over every single\
type of company that can get these\
reports these risk scores all this\
information on you and that can be\
credit cards homes payday loans personal\
title Auto student loans employers\
tenant screening all of this information\
is here it goes over that for you but\
let's go back up to the table of\
contents so in figure one know your data\
there's three steps to this process this\
is very important you can get your\
report from these companies on this list\
often for free and that is under the\
Fair Credit Reporting Act all consumer\
reporting companies are required to\
provide a copy of the information in the\
report and many do so for free now of\
course we know the bigger Nationwide\
companies that is TransUnion Experian\
and Equifax but there are a lot of other\
companies that we need to be aware of so\
in this process step one you can\
requested from all of these places step\
two is review step three is dispute you\
can dispute any piece of information\
that these places are reporting you just\
need to make sure that you one request\
it and two review it to make sure that\
the information is accurate and if it's\
not you have the right to dispute it\
okay and then for a couple examples\
let's just go through a few of these so\
let's go to Nationwide consumer\
reporting companies The Big Three that\
we know Equifax TransUnion Experian we\
know about those but if we keep\
scrolling down they have other sections\
like employment screening so if you\
wanted to maybe know why your background\
checks were coming back a certain way\
you can't get this job this or that you\
can actually take a look at all of these\
companies and you can see exactly who's\
reporting this information you can\
request a report of this information and\
you can dispute this information there's\
lots of places here I've looked at\
higher right few times they have a free\
report that you can request and you can\
also dispute all right and you can keep\
going down and check anything they have\
all types of one for tenants if you had\
an issue with tenant screening you can\
actually go here and remove information\
from these particular data Furnitures\
there's amrent AppFolio contemporary\
information Corp Experian rent Bureau\
all of these would be the reason why\
you're having issues with that and you\
can dispute this information and again\
there's so many for deposit accounts and\
payment screenings you guys know a\
couple of these we talked about check\
systems there's a video on that about\
how to remove that information we talked\
about early warnings there's a video on\
that if you have any issues you can find\
the places that are reporting that here\
for personal property insurance so the\
reason why I really wanted to go through\
this is so you understand there are so\
many data furnishers that you were\
unaware of and and if you're having a\
specific issue find the furniture that's\
reporting that information request the\
report and you can dispute it to\
completely remove that information so\
again I'm going to link this in the\
description if you would like to\
download this I recommend that you have\
it if you're having any issues here and\
you can go through a similar process\
with any of the other secondary bureaus\
in order to get the information deleted\
now I am going to show you how to opt\
out of some major secondary bureaus as\
well as freezing the information step by\
step in the next part of the video the\
LexisNexis\
first one that we're going to be looking\
at is Lexus Nexus and this is going to\
be how to request a security freeze now\
there's two separate options for this\
one there's a security freeze and then\
there's opting out and we are going to\
be going through both options if we\
request a security freeze the link is in\
the description if you want to just\
click on it and you can follow along for\
this part of the video the first thing\
that you need to do is request your\
security freeze online you'll see the\
same option here and you'll click on it\
once you click on this option you can\
fill out all of your personal\
information here and then they're going\
to ask you to upload documents now it\
could be your driver's license or\
another form of documentation from\
category one or from category it can\
be your social your passport um your\
military identification card as well as\
a recent cable a utility bill phone\
statement bank or credit card statement\
a rental lease anything in this list you\
can use and then you can place that\
security freeze all you have to do is\
submit the information here so it's a\
very straightforward very simple process\
it doesn't take you very long and if you\
decided to lift this freeze because a\
lot of companies will use Lexus Nexus in\
order to identify you you can call and\
you can have it lifted immediately also\
o want to mention two other options that\
you have you can also request a security\
freeze by mail if you couldn't do it\
online you can also request your\
security freeze by phone if you would\
rather talk to someone first and then\
these are pretty much all the ways that\
we're going to do a freeze or opt out of\
all of these particular companies but I\
just want you to see all of the\
different options that you do have to\
freeze and to lift later on if you need\
to do that now here is the Lexus Nexus\
opt out form I'm just going to zoom in\
here now this is also going to be in the\
description all right you can click on\
that it'll take you to the same exact\
page you'll give the reason why you\
don't want your information to be seen\
and you can choose I do not want my\
information shared I am a public elected\
official so on and so forth then you can\
select that option or other if you want\
to type something in put in your\
explanation now I just want to overstate\
this just because you opt out of Lexus\
Nexus does not mean that companies\
cannot view that report like I said in\
the beginning they can still look at the\
report if they have verifiable\
information to show that they have the\
right to look at this in order to\
collect something in order to review a\
piece of information they can get this\
report so if you want to actually get\
the information removed I have a video\
that you can watch it will show you step\
by step how to remove information from\
Lexus Nexus now after you select your\
reason it will ask for your information\
here your first name last name your\
social you'll add a person on the next\
screen then it's going to ask you to\
fill out all of your identifiable\
information your address things like\
that your phone number once that's all\
completed you'll get confirmation that\
you have opted out and once again if you\
want to opt back in you have that option\
you can either do it by mail you can\
give the a phone call or you can also\
request that online okay let's move on\
to the next company the next company\
Innovis\
that we're looking at is inovis there's\
a video that shows you step by step how\
to remove information from inovis but\
even if you remove all derogatory\
information you still may want to opt\
out so this information cannot be shared\
for marketing purposes so it lets you\
know right here consumer reporting\
agencies May Supply marketing lists to\
creditors and insurers which use these\
lists to make offers in order to give\
you things so if you want to avoid\
solicitation and phone calls this is a\
great way to do that now you can do this\
online by going to optout request form\
optoutprescreen.com you can also call\
here or you can mail now if we go to the\
opt out prescreen this is what you're\
met with optoutprescreen.com it gives\
you all the information here and you can\
click here to opt in or you can click\
here to opt out now for most of us we\
don't want our information shed\
and when you do decide to opt out like\
right here electronically it lets you\
know you're opting out for years all\
right it's only for years if you want\
to permanently opt out you have to do\
this by mail all right so you can decide\
which one that you would like to do if\
you would like to do it online it's only\
for years you fly your information\
first name last name social date of\
birth basically all the same things that\
we already discussed your security code\
here and then you confirm now this can\
take a little while to process but once\
it is done they will not be able to\
share your data or your information the\
FactorTrust\
next company that we're looking at is\
Factor trust the link will also be in\
the description if you want to opt out\
of this company now Factor trust is a\
consumer reporting agency that provides\
Consumer Reports to thirdparty companies\
for the purpose of credit risk\
assessment and other purposes as\
permitted by law now you can request a\
copy of this online here and you can\
also have them mail you a hard copy now\
this is a TransUnion company now you can\
place the security freeze on here if you\
click here and that security freeze is\
referred to as a freeze because it\
prevents lenders from checking this\
report and giving them more control over\
information and when they can access it\
when you opt out this will not allow\
them to once again share your\
information for credit or insurance or\
pre-screen you for offers that you have\
not asked them to offer you and when you\
click here you'll be brought to the\
opt-in or opt out once again electronic\

opt out permanently then you can opt out\

description check systems will be the\
ChexSytems\
next company there is a note here that I\
want you to pay attention to after\
submitting an opt out request to check\
Systems Inc you may continue to receive\
marketing material from companies that\
do not use check systems they're just\
letting you know that not every company\
will be using their information it could\
be multiple companies which is why you\
want to opt out of all of these and if\
you want your information to be excluded\
permanently you may print complete sign\
and return the check system permanent\
opt out electronic form that would be\
the way to get rid of it completely but\
you can also submit this request online\

methods are also here you can give them\
a phone call it is up to you to decide\
which one you would prefer now here is a\

in there and request the information be\
deleted if you would like to do that\
please refer to the check systems\
removal video the next company that\
Clarity\
we're looking at is Clarity Services Inc\
and this is part of Experian same as\
Factor trust but it's part of TransUnion\
so with this one it is a -year opt out\
these companies will all operate the\
exact same way if you want to opt out\
permanently you will need to mail that\
but you can enter all your information\
in here and submit and this will opt you\
out of clarity for any pre-screen offers\
that you did not request now the last\
Teletrack\
company that we're going to be looking\
at is teletrack and this is the Equifax\
version of what factor trust and what\
Clarity is for Experian so this is a\
consumer reporting agency that provides\
information to third parties for the\
purposes of credit and risk assessment\

exact thing first name last name enter\
all your information and you can choose\
to place a temporary freeze a lift and\

permanently you'll have to mail it in\

you found any information is inaccurate\
and you can get that deleted but you can\
also opt out here as well and you'll\
want to follow the steps for opting out\
now if you have previously opted out and\

How to Build Business Credit in |\'a0\
through the process because I've I've interviewed other credit guys and they all have just different philosophies on how to go about getting people credit I\
mean when I started um I didn't know about business credit I just simply went and got all these\
personal lines of credit that's what I did too yeah yeah so tell me like what\
what's kind of your guys's philosophy on credit yeah you know we we definitely work with um like a lot of people who\
want to get access to money fast and they also don't want to hurt their credit score either so\
obviously the best way to do that is getting business credit that doesn't report to their personal credit report\
right so um you know we often don't really go through the whole like net kind of\
vendor card stuff um in our space like in my company just because we work with a lot of people\
that want to get their hands on money quickly right so um we often just take the fast approach\
of you know using personal credit score right to get approved for that you know\
business credit card and you know many people may think like oh I need to use my personal credit to get the business\
credit card while it's ultimately you who's you know borrowing the money so the bank's going to want to look into\
you to make sure that you're going to be a you know good candidate to accept a\
business credit card from them so what I mean if if you're gonna use your\
personal credit to go get business credit I mean what's the point of getting business credit why not just sure get personal credit there's there's\
a lot of good benefits to it because you're going to get higher limits than you would normally get on personal\
credit cards you also have access to relationship managers and they could really help you get very high limits\
compared to what the algorithm may give you online for a business credit card\
um you know it's also something that's more so tied to your business than your personal credit report right now\
obviously if you default on it you know there may be some consequences to your personal credit however if you max out a\
business credit card um it's not going to affect your personal credit so\
um really it's only going to affect your relationship with that bank specifically so say maybe you got a business credit\
card with maybe U.S bank or something like that right but then you wanted to go get a car loan with a credit union\
well if you have twenty thousand dollars maxed out on that U.S bank card it's not going to affect your ability to get a\
good rate on a car loan with some credit union right so it keeps you\
in a really good spot so it even though you need your personal credit to qualify\
for that business credit you're saying it's not going to impact it as you utilize it that's correct yeah the\
personal credit is going to be completely untouched if you're you know now there are some business credit cards\
you know like discover Capital One TD Bank um now like if you Max those out you\
know those often do report to personal credit score so you know normally we\
stay away from those kinds of banks but most business credit cards other than\
like those Banks if you Max them out you know like a thirty thousand dollar limit\
your personal credit score is not going to tank which is like super important because especially if you want to get\
more business credit cards I've done this with a lot of people where they've came to me and they've had a maxed out\
business credit card and they question like oh well will I still get approved for more business credit cards even\
though this one business credit card is maxed out and then we take a look at their personal credit they have like \
score or something like that and they're still able to go to other Banks to get approvals for more business credit cards\
because you know the bank's not exposing all too much money to this candidate\
already right so um you wouldn't necessarily want to go back to the same bank that's already\
exposing a lot of money to you at that current moment but you'd want to go to another bank\
um where they're not necessarily going to see that when they look into your personal credit report right so when\
they pull your experience they're not going to see that you have um this twenty thousand dollars of debt\
if they re unless they really dig into like the Small Business Financial exchange and like those business credits\
but they're really really looking mostly at your personal credit and your personal borrowing history\
okay yeah because I remember when my um personal credit was super maxed out\
um it was in like the s like yeah yeah I know what that's like yeah\
and I honestly I didn't care because I I wasn't getting a car loan I had a car\
paid for in cash and I um it was like it wasn't an expensive car it's like a \
car and I wasn't looking to buy rental properties or things like that because I didn't have a job I couldn't\
get like you know a normal mortgage and so I was like look the next two years I'm just gonna build my business and\
keep utilizing this cash over and over again and I have zero percent so I don't really care and I'm gonna just keep it\
maxed out and whatever that's what I did I just didn't even try to like increase\
my credit and I I knew that too I couldn't even go really increase it because I still had\
the capital out you know working a real estate deal so I was kind of just like I didn't care\
sure you know and and that's definitely um like an approach that's totally something I've done myself right when I\
first started with like personal credit and you know I think it's definitely something that you know if if you're in\
that similar situation like you and I were in where you know it didn't really matter you know I'm focused on building my business right then all the power to\
actually do it but also you know to keep in mind too like say maybe you max out your cards you've kind\
of reached the end of the road um it's definitely also good to have that that business credit where you know\
maybe oh maybe I have to go get more business credit um or else you have to get something called like a bridge loan where you know\
maybe you have someone who pays down your credit card debts for you so you could get more business credit say if\
you reach like an end of the road situation where now your score's in the s you might not be able to get\
business credit or lending products so um yeah tell me you were telling me this a\
little bit earlier tell me about Bridge loans yeah because I you know we hear about Bridge loans for Real Estate sure\
you were telling me like bridge loan for these credit guys is really interesting it is pretty interesting yeah so\
um a friend of mine uh Curtis actually introduced me to this idea of bridge loans and\
um when I was getting into the funding space um I only knew like a little bit about it and he was explaining to me how it\
was going to help obviously me bring on more people that I can help get funding for which I thought that was a great\
idea because I wanted to help more people with this right it's something that's obviously benefited both you and\
I you know we both are huge Advocates of credit and think it's you know super powerful when starting a business so you\
know being able to help more people is super important to me as well so the thing about Bridge Loan basically\
what it is is that say someone has maybe thirty thousand dollars of credit card\
debt that's keeping their score maybe around like low to mid s maybe even s right\
um they have like no late payments or you know derogatory marks things like that you know someone like that can actually\
still get approved for business credit cards however they actually need to pay down their their credit card debt first\
right because the bank's going to pull their credit they're going to say oh well this person has\
um too high of balances amongst his revolving trade lines and they're just going to turn you down so if you could\
find an actual person this is not a debt consolidation loan but if you could find an actual person who has money available\
to lend to you to pay down your cards this is going to boost your score up and\
you could actually get approved for more credit and this makes sense to do really on\
your personal credit cards you can do it with business credit cards to get more business credit cards with the same bank\
right so maybe you have a maxed out Chase card and you want to get another Chase card but you can't pay down that\
Max down Chase Card well Chase isn't going to expose more credit until you pay down your existing debt that you owe\
to them so you can find a bridge loan lender who has money available in their\
checking account to temporarily lend to you so you could pay down that card allow the statement to come around apply\
for another card and then you know you could then pay back the lender using credit cards so to recap this it's\
basically like uh to your point it's a bridge on short term like uh you know I'll make this\
simple so everyone can understand like I let's just say I have k of credit maxed out\
um well actually I'll use you you have k of credit maxed out I have Capital as a lender and my Capital could have\
came from credit too yeah uh it could come from cash credit whatever right and I say hey I'm gonna make this agreement\
with you I'm gonna pay off your grand of credit cards okay for the next couple of weeks while your credit score adjusts\
to that payment your credit's gonna go up and then you're going to be able to apply for\
you know business lines and other things now they have a good score and then once those are approved you're then going to\
pay me back yeah with credit yeah that's exactly correct got it\
that is a I I've never heard that one but I mean the to me it's like there's always just\
ways to like utilize money and debt and and you know help accomplish people or\
help people accomplish their goals but I would imagine me as the lender I'd want a pretty big\
amount because I'm kind of taking a risk that dude yeah what happens if you don't pay me back yeah no that's totally a\
risk to consider right I mean you know I've I've definitely seen you know some instances of that but normally you run\
into to good people I mean genuinely people are often really good people out there and as long as you set the\
expectations right and you know you're very strong on kind of like that initial call just as a contract too yeah the\
contract right before engaging in the business in the service right you're qualifying that person making sure that\
they're a good fit to lend to right um that's all very important\
um but yeah it often is a pretty high fee uh associated with it however is\
ultimately like a bridge for you to get to you know that greater outcome right because maybe say in your case right you\
made twenty five thousand fifteen thousand from your first flips right but say maybe you weren't able to get\
approved for business credit right maybe your score already was pretty low and you had maxed out cards but you just\
found you know flipping houses right so you know you get a bridge loan and then\
you get approved for that right and now you're you know smooth sailing right so that fee almost you know if\
you're going to be able to accomplish that kind of result right what does that fee really matter because\
now look at the amount of success that yeah you know yeah I mean like I've said this all the time with hard money\
lenders and other things like you know people um when I was first getting in the industry they were like dude you can't\
pay hard money lenders these guys are Loan Sharks they're they're gonna charge you crazy interest and points and all\
this stuff I was like yeah I mean it kind of is what it is\
um yeah it is what it is well for me I'm just like it's a cost of doing business exactly with even the the credit cards\
what happened was I had zero percent interest for like months on just varying cards and even after the \
months I still kept them maxed out even though I was paying yeah because I\
was like well I'm still making a lot more so like what do I care and um you know I think like with this\
it's an interesting thing because to me you just run the analysis of like okay\
well how much am I gonna get approved for by doing this right so it's like all right I owe you know\
or uoand let's just say I was gonna let you go borrow my grand it's high\
risk for me and I'm like bro you're going to pay me five grand to do this yeah right and\
you know you you go out there and you apply for these things now that your credit's good and you go get you know I\
don't know Grand of credit it's like dude I would happily pay five grand\
to go sure access to another or because I know I can make a lot more\
than five grand yeah yeah no totally no you bring up a really good point there for sure and then I know you also\
mentioned a little bit about kind of repercussions things like that I mean you know ultimately in the worst case\
scenarios obviously never want to get to that point it could get to the point of you know like small claims courts it\
could get you know into like nasty legal stuff it could get you know collection agencies after borrowers right you\
always want to avoid those situations but um that's like kind of the risk associated with the lender is you know\
when am I going to get my money back yeah how long would it take for somebody to typically get their money back in that scenario you know in those\
scenarios it could it could be a very long time um which is a long time\
could be a couple of months uh well I guess walk me through like what's the typical time frame for somebody to go\
pay down there yeah in like the worst case scenario\
right like that's how long it could take but typically Bridge loans last no\
longer than maybe two three four five weeks so it takes a month for you know\
because you're gonna have your payment or whatever reporting coming up right exactly so I'm gonna pay that thing\
before reporting yeah and it's going to report that you've paid it off yeah it's at that\
point the lender can ask for their money back right confidently safely right so there should like right in a perfect\
world there should be no issue having that repayment right and what how would they pay him back they would just charge\
the card to like plastic or something um you know they could just charge the cards through a payment processor so the\
lender can have a payment processor so a lot of people don't have that yeah yeah I know a lot of people don't have that\
however it can be easily set up with you know stripe you know payment processors\
which I would describe you for Grand yeah yeah and it just go right back on\
your personal credit yeah exactly and now the borrower you know say they had\
all this debt on personal credit at interest you know now they're paying it\
back at zero percent so they've even saved some money there because maybe they were paying per year on thirty\
thousand dollars right that's about five thousand six thousand per year right and\
you know now you just did this bridge loan to go get approved for more zero percent cards you move all the balances\
to the zero percent cards now you've actually saved yourself you know you're gonna pay the the lender right but\
you've also now moved it to zero percent cards too right no I I've honestly I've heard a lot of\
tricks and trades of credit and that that's one that I never thought of and\
I'm like yeah dude if the borrower was right I would totally be a lender for that that's yeah some good passive income\
well yeah no exactly yeah no it like and that's very important too it's just screening your borrowers making sure\
that they're a good fit um before you know lending them money so that way you could avoid any kind of\
trouble with repayment right it's obviously something you have to acknowledge and be wary of when you're\
engaging in that kind of business but oftentimes it's pretty smooth as long as you're actually lending to the right\
people um I've done this with maybe over people at this point and it's gone very\
smooth maybe like one or two bad eggs I've seen but you know pretty consistently I've seen you know really\
good really really really good outcomes as long as you know the screening process goes very well yeah I like that\
idea so what I'm curious too about with business credit or just llc's like how\
long do you have to have an LLC and all that very good I mean typically it's best to have one open for couple of\
months however there's nothing stopping you from getting approved for business credit even with the business that's\
open you know for like one day in fact actually one of my top success stories\
inside my my own funding program um he actually got approved for \
of zero percent interest business credit on an LLC that was not even like two\
weeks old right so he had you know joined my program you know May th and\
by you know June st all without starting with an LLC he had thousand dollars\
of available credit right yeah so however it's it's definitely going to be a factor for the people who have you\
know like lower credit scores um who don't have the best credit profile if they're\
giving the bank more reasons to say no they're you know gonna give the bank more reasons to say no right but you\
know if you have really really good credit and you're giving the bank very minimal reasons to say no with a brand\
new business you know you can still get approved for what are the reasons Banks say no\
you know there's there's tons of reasons it's going to be based on you know all the credit factors that you know add up\
to what make your credit score right maybe it could be something with having a late payment or maybe some kind of um\
internal kind of uh thing that happened in the past maybe you had you know a\
charge off with the bank um it could be you know too high of credit card utilization right those are some basic\
ones but some other ones that people might not you know think of are maybe you've opened up too many recent you\
know credit cards right maybe also you know you've yeah opened too many accounts maybe you have too new of a\
business sometimes that's usually in the case of you know tougher Biz like you\

again wealthyinvestor.com apply for a call today right how how much of a\
difference does it make for like your how high your credit score\
is versus like your actual income yeah very good question I mean more so\
they are going to look at personal credit you know revolving trade lines that's another thing too like if you're\
looking for an increase this is why it's like really important to like make sure your personal credit is good at the same\
time you know wanting to get high approvals for business credit cards because the bank will look for\
comparable trade lines on your personal credit so they'll look to see like you\
know what kind of credit limits other banks have already approved you for on your personal credit so\
you know that's definitely like important to you but back to like the income aspect of things you know income's certainly going to matter it'll\
certainly help you get a higher limit on a card but um they're really going to\
look at that personal credit borrowing history you could have you could be making a year but if you have\
like a like depends they don't like they're not gonna like so dumb that like a broke person with is better I know\
it it's very it's very interesting I've definitely seen a lot of cases where someone's making sixty thousand dollars\
a year with a credit score get approved for more money than someone who makes four times the amount than they\
make in a year yeah I think they're getting more credit than the money they make and then the guy who actually makes a lot of money is not getting anything I\
know it's it's crazy how it works yeah yeah that's crazy uh I I know this too\
so I remember early on in my career I was applying for business credit for my\
house slipping company and every time the bank would do it they'd be like so what do you do I'm like I'm it's a house whipping business and they did not like\
that yeah now that's like super important too that's definitely something I run into a lot with people is they have this idea of what they want\
to use the funding for however they also have to you know talk about the lower\
risk activities in which they're engaging in with their business because you know some of the things that you're\
doing besides just you know investing and flipping is um you're also doing you know management you're also providing\
like other services like within your business right and you want to be able to go to the bank and have a really good\
story straight so that way you're not throwing yourself under the bus by saying something high risk and then they\
turn you away I've seen a couple of people where they have some kind of you know very like risky kind of crypto\
Forex website online yeah yeah I got a super X crazy weapon yeah yeah and\
they've yeah the bank just turned them around they said yeah we can't take you on as a client so I've definitely seen\
that it's not fun when that happens but um that's why it's like so important to have a really strong story going into\
the bank um that way you don't throw yourself under the bus you know yeah typically like I'll go in\
there and say I'm a consultant right which I am I'm a consultant right but if I'm going in there talking about like\
credit things like that they may like that they may not like that right so you know I might as well stick with\
something a lot more see a consultant is a much better business than saying hey oh yeah get more credit oh yeah I help\
people figure out how to you know mess up your system yeah yeah you know\
you'd be surprised though a lot of a lot of relationship managers actually they know what you're doing well because they\
do they're they're making a ton well yeah yeah you know the real it's that's why it's so good again in touch with the\
relationship manager versus applying for things through the algorithm because um with them they actually make money by\
giving you a card the more that you spend on that credit card the more money the bank makes so the bank doesn't want\
to lend to someone who's gonna max out a card and then yeah not churn through it\
right spend and pay it back spend and pay it back that's what the credit card is for right but when you're holding on\
like sure they want you to use zero percent they do want you to spend money on it they do want you to carry a balance a little bit but they also don't\
want you to be you know out all this money and not churning through the card you know the it's not just what's in it\
for you know that relationship manager but what's in it for the bank too because they're going to make money based on you spending on the card you\
know through those back end processing fees and you know they also make money when you bring your checking account\
over when you get into their other products things like that so they really really especially you know and it's a\
little bit weird times right now with what just happened last week but the bank really wants your business and will\
attract do with a zero percent offer hmm yeah do you have any idea how these relationship managers get paid like I\
mean I know well they got like a base they get like a salary but they get bonuses on you know the amount of spend\
that is generated on the card They also make money um not just on the spend but also like\
you know how many clients they're bringing into their ecosystem um so those are like some some major\
ways they do have like some you know kind of sales commission incentive but you know they also get paid obviously a\
salary too um okay so let's talk about this this whole\
banking thing you just mentioned it um you know I don't know when this episode's gonna get released but you\
know recently Silicon Valley Bank just went under yeah like they uh\
you know what's crazy to me is I I'm watching the bank and just the story\
develop and I remember seeing it on like Friday or something and they're like yeah Peter thiel's telling everyone to\
remove their money from Silicon Valley Bank and I'm like wow that's kind of like heartless you know like yeah this\
bank has helped a ton of startup Founders they've been around for like years and you know a lot of Peter\
thiel's Investments I'm sure in that bank right and then yeah you know like a day later they're\
basically like yeah Silicon Valley Bank's going under like yeah they're they're on a bank run and they're toast\
and then the next day they're like dude what's gonna happen to all these depositors of them don't have FDIC\
insurance and you know the next day they're like all right everyone's gonna be made whole and it was like the\
fastest developing thing ever but I'm just like dude I mean this bank was like\
years old having like billion dollars of deposits and they got hit\
with a bank run and then yeah Signature Bank ends up getting going under and then I was reading something about\
Credit Suisse today or whatever it's called and I'm just like what the heck is going on in the world yeah it is\
pretty crazy I mean you know nothing stays the same forever right so you know always got to be on your toes you know\
really just you know keep your money safe right you know I mean the FDIC insurance is really you know very\
powerful thing to have especially too but um but yeah no it's definitely a crazy\
situation that's happening right now yeah I mean what do you think is going to happen I guess in your\
industry right because sure I've thought about this a lot with um recessions right sure\
it starts to become harder to get access to money no that's totally right yeah I mean that's where you know it's very\
important too especially like right now you know say if there's someone out there watching this like who has things\
like wrong with their credit maybe they have a late payment a derogatory Mark right it's like super important to get\
that you know fixed because even during like the recession it's kind of crazy what starts happening right like you\
know people are losing their jobs but also people want to start businesses there's always people who want to start businesses right but it obviously is\
going to become harder to get access to credit right and you know you know the\
banks are still going to give out credit you know they may not give as much or they may not you know kind of they may\
tighten like their circle of people that they would lend money to you know maybe someone who would have gotten approved\
with uh like a low score maybe that threshold increases to a higher credit\
score right um however yeah that's why it's like super important just keep all you know your\
ducks in a row just make sure that your credit is really is what as good as what can be take care of it because if you\
are in that situation where you need to get approved you know you're going to want to make sure that you know your\
credit is in order you know to get that approval when the time comes right yeah\
no like I I think um you gotta always be prepared like you're\
saying I think that um things are going to get harder credit wise to get I mean uh how have you seen\
you know you've been doing it now for over two years um the industry changed since when covid\
when you get into it yeah in the middle of covid when money is being handed out like hotcakes yeah and then now it's\
different yeah no it's I mean the banks are still lending a lot of money right now I mean even now like you know it\
seems like every Monday like one of my relationship managers sends me all these like new approvals from the weekend you\
know they're still looking to bring on new new clients especially with the frenzy I know I've talked to a couple of\
Bankers like the past couple of days and they're like oh yeah I've just been super busy with you know all the\
craziness that's going on like bringing on new clients like talking to new people you know all of that\
um but yeah no it is is going to be very interesting um it's just going to tighten up but I\
wouldn't say it's going to be completely like non-existent you know people are still going to be able to get approved\
but it's definitely going to be you know a little bit tougher you know just as the example before\
so what would be your tips to somebody who is\
um looking at getting more credit or some tips they can take yeah I mean you\
know I think and especially with what we mentioned just now too it's like having relationship managers is going to be\
like super super important because you know they're going to help you get approved than what you would be able to\
get on your own through the algorithm right right and so what I mean when you do that how do you get a relationship\
manager and like instead of just applying on freaking whatever website yeah a lot of it is just really like\
simple communication right and you know you know a lot of these relationship\
managers you know they're not they they bounce around from Branch to Branch sometimes you know they're not even\
available like in a branch you know you have to kind of go up the chain a little bit to get to them and sometimes they're\
really hard to get in touch with because they're only going to work with businesses that do over one or two\
million dollars a year right so you know it's not always so easy for someone to\
just call into the bank and ask for one of these relationship managers especially if they have a brand new business because you know they're gonna\
the the teller or whoever's there is gonna you know go follow protocol and keep them exclusive to the businesses\
that are producing a lot of Revenue um you know which you know through a lot of you know trial and error a lot of\
calling things like that you could eventually find really cool Bankers like people I've been able to meet who are\
willing to help people who are just starting out too right percent yeah because I um I mean I\
know this game is like all about relationships right and so everything that I've ever accomplished has never\
been just freaking yeah on your own thing and it's good success Trump comes\
through people exactly yeah so you're you're just in constant communication with these relationship managers\
um is is like American Express still just like the best limits\
that's a good question I mean they I'm like forever grateful for American Express personally because they\
definitely helped me get my start um those were like the credit cards that I used\
um when I started my business but yeah they do and you know sometimes it could be a little challenging because I have\
seen people that just get you know straight up K when they just start um if they like apply through the\
algorithm while other people you know can get um you know thirty five thousand dollars\
I've seen other Banks be able to get give way higher amounts way bigger\
approvals um but Amex is still really really great card company\
um you know it is you know and those relationship managers as well are harder to get in touch with because everything\
they do is online there's no physical branches I mean oftentimes when you call you're speaking to someone in a\
different country or in a customer service role so um I've had a couple of people actually\
inside my group who've referred me some American Express Representatives is that they've been able to work with\
themselves so they're hard to work with we have them um at American Express and so that's\
like the main thing we've been getting for our businesses but it's just like dude even just doing it it's like the\
communication is just super bad yeah well I mean they're they're pretty\
algorithmic I mean you just apply for like they just have everything set up\
for you to like apply online like instant decisions right right and you know that's why it's good to you know\
kind of understand like how credit Works especially as a business owner and be resourceful as a business owner to be\
able to expand outside of just Amex alone right to be able to get into other banks that you may have not heard of\
right right but what's your thoughts on like these small Banks now because everybody's scared of the small banks\
with the runs on yeah Silicon Valley yeah I mean you know you obviously want to make sure that you know you're\
you know covering your bases with an FDIC insured account sure I mean that's like I'm just simple yes getting credit\
credit from these small Banks yeah very good question I mean because you know say like that bank closes your credit\
line can close right so it's always good to have options right just because you have one business credit card doesn't\
mean that that's enough right it's good to have a couple of credit cards right you know some with some big Banks some\
with some some small Banks too right right so you know it's good to have options because if something like that\
happens with Silicon Valley bank and now oh man this this was my primary credit line that I was using you know now\
you're back to square one and you know maybe you have to you know start applying for more credit cards maybe you\
also need a bridge loan yeah you know something like that right so it's good to have options I mean I know a lot of\
people that don't like to have too many credit cards but it's good to have like maybe a handful or two yeah yeah I've\
seen some people with like credit cards like yeah yeah that's what it's like for me\
I've I think I've have now ah nearly like credit cards I've gotten over the last two years so you\
should have brought them dude yeah they're in my car yeah so I I know this is changing all the\
time but what's like your current favorite credit card like because I know it's just there's different offers I\
really do like I really do like the AmEx card right now but this one the gold card okay you know well that's that's\
not zero percent either but we have it I don't even know dude it's so funny I gotta well you answer that I'll say this\
sure like one of my guys is all about points and like yeah all these things he's like bro you gotta do this this and\
this I'm like bro I don't have time for this like freaking he's like well I can refer you to the um this guy he like can\
you can go be first class to wherever I'm like I would rather just go make more money like I'm not gonna deal with\
freaking yeah yeah trying to figure this thing out and so when they apply for our business cards they're all like gold or\
platinum and I'm like yeah I have no idea the difference of why I use one or the other I I couldn't tell you what its\
bonuses are or anything sure yeah I like using the gold card a lot because uh you\
know for me personally I spend a lot of money on YouTube advertising okay so you\
know I get four times points on every dollar I spend for YouTube advertising so if I'm spending you know plus\
a month I'm getting points that's like eight round trips back to New Jersey right so I could go and see\
my family for free whenever I want yeah dude honestly I don't even know what we do with our points yeah oh they might\
just be sitting there I know I know some other people in our space that just have points sitting one of my one of my\
mentors showed me like four and a half million Amex points he's like I haven't used these and I don't know how long I'm\
like man you could fly like your whole team on a trip instead of you know using uh you could save some some cash I guess\
right but yeah you can use all those points to you know like that's million points it's like\
I think that's equivalent to like of plane tickets that's a lot of\
that's a good that's a that's good for a whole team yeah my thing with the points\
has always been like people use them for flights and stuff and I've always just taken the cash back\
and I'm just like I don't really understand the difference yeah yeah I mean it's to each their own right\
um you know like I I like cash back cards a lot I don't really go for points cards all so much unless it's for a\
purpose right right so I mean even with the scenario you talked about earlier\
with uh you know sure I'm paying interest on a card which most people hate paying interest right but if you're\
making money like does it really matter if you're getting a greater return on investment by paying that interest\
anyway yeah right well I'm gonna tell the team to start using um the Gold Card Gold Card on our point because that's\
the best for ad spend yeah is it better than the Platinum well the Platinum you\
know I mean to be honest like I have like a little bias like maybe I have my own I have my\
own opinions about the platinum card I think it's a little bit of a waste to be honest I mean I think there's some valuable things with it like the Dell\
credit and you know maybe indeed credit and Adobe credit all these different things that you can get with the\
platinum card um but you know it doesn't really\
you know attack kind of like those main spend categories right like you know\
who's gonna spend like you know like not everyone but you know if you're spending like you get five times points on travel\
right not everyone who's a business owner is just going to be spending on like flights all day they're going to be\
spending on Advertising they're going to be spending on softwares they might be taking clients out to restaurants right\
you know things where you could actually get better points um you know business software stuff like\
that where the gold card like rewards you for those things like spend money on the gold card but use like the Platinum\
for all the the luxury kind of you know like Centurion Lounge things you know\
you could get your annual fee back by you know investing into like Dell you know that's why I got myself like a\
printer using like the Dell credit right so you know that you invest in Adele and you can wait oh like yeah yeah like you\
get four hundred dollars of Dell credit right like Dell like computer company uh-huh right like an Epson printer or\
like yeah no I didn't know yeah so I got like an Epson printer\
um on dell.com right actually I forgot about this um epson's actually uh sponsoring us now so\
shout out to Epson oh that's cool yeah they're getting us like a big printer thing\
I don't really know what we're gonna do with it I think it can make us like banners and all these cool songs for\
business and well that's going to be cool for maybe your uh your upcoming event in Hollywood right exactly so\
we're going to be using that stuff for wealthcon and then I think they're printing us like shirts or something like it's gonna it's gonna be a cool\
thing but like they actually sent it to us the other day of like this giant Epson printer yeah it's cool yeah\
but you're saying back to credit cards I could just go by Dell and then get my\
what's those your annual fee it's like bucks or something so yeah like bucks I think it's now okay\
that's crazy yeah like I remember every card I used to get was always free there's no annual yeah yeah no I think\
it's crazy for the platinum card I think that because there's like really no benefit for like spend categories right\
um like five times points on I don't know why I have Platinum but I do yeah and it's what I use the most there's no\
Rhyme or Reason yeah yeah well I mean you could get one and a half points on\
you know on on purchases over five thousand dollars but you could then instead get\
like you know there's other cards out there like Chase Premiere where you could get two and a half percent cash\
back on purchases over five thousand dollars really that's yeah two and a half percent is the most I've ever heard\
yeah I think it's up to a certain amount I don't often get that card for everyone because a lot of people want zero\
percent they're just starting out but right you know that's for like you know Big Spenders right so\
um you know U.S bank has a similar option with their their leverage card two percent cash back on all your\
purchases right so I mean that's gonna my first card ever that like when this was back when I was broke I was and\
it's like I guess I should apply for a credit card I'm an adult now and\
I I was just looking it up on my own and I was like okay what's the best cash back I don't care about all these\
freaking points and stuff I just want money yeah and at that time like one\
percent was like the standard and then there was this card called the Fidelity card and that was\
two two dollars back and I was like wow this thing's crazy so I applied for it\
got it I had to open up a Fidelity account for it to work and all that and like I've literally had that car for\
like years yeah yeah yeah no I mean well I'm so yeah\
I've only had a crap my oldest credit card I think is like six years old something like that yeah it's like this\
Bank of America card that's crazy yeah I uh I'm I'm like now thinking I'm like\
dude how many points do we have I'm just like are you gonna go check I'm looking but I also I think our CFO is\
like taking over all the stuff so I don't even I don't even know yeah\
but yeah what's up you know what I I'll tell you one of the things that\
always made me super mad was uh I could never get approved for a\
Chase card yeah you know they have very interesting kind of you know underwriting system\
right so that's why it's you know really good to have a relationship manager for for like a business card especially I\
mean they could do a little bit with personal cards but they're not going to do much with the personal cards the\
relationship managers they're focused on working with businesses um helping them get business lending\
products helping them with you know different business products right and business credit cards are just one\
product of many things that they offer and yeah just back to that point you\
know like getting approved for for Chase cards you know you know there's obviously people out there that talk about like rule\
things like that but if you know what is that basically if you if you are approved for more than five personal\
credit cards in the last months they're pretty much just gonna shut their doors on you and say you can't get\
anything from us right now so if you know a relationship manager however they could help you get around\
that you know too much new credit in the last however many months reasoning why\
you would get denied right which is what the rule is just for them right not every bank has that but that is a reason\
why people get denied for credit cards is that they've opened up too many credit cards recently right right that\
was a that was the reason I was denied for a credit card like a couple of months ago I opened like seven personal\
cards like a year ago and it was like seven months since I opened them and I tried applying for a\
card I got denied and then you know I did like some some little tricks of you know showing spend on other cards and\
you know opening up a checking account and then I wound up getting approved for like you know like a month later hmm\
so I guess my question is uh and we were kind of talking about this\
little offline but like okay these people that come to you and they get um all this credit like the main thing\
is for me anyways you better have like a reason to use it yeah because what's the\
point of just starting the clock on zero percent if you don't even know what the heck you're gonna do with it no totally\
no totally right and that's definitely something I run into a lot and there's like so many business models that we\
were talking about offline other than you know just like normally what people see online like real estate or like\
crypto or e-commerce or YouTube I mean you were even suggesting like go give you know your zero percent interest\
credit to a poker player right it's uh I think that's player staking yeah poker players staking out here in Las Vegas\
right yeah well no what made me think of that was uh because you were saying people will lend it to like these\
traders to trade for them oh yeah and I was like well yeah I mean you could if you trusted that person but you know\
it's like in Vegas so many of these um poker players they take you know they sell basically like a portion of um yeah\
what they could win it's like okay you know what you're gonna buy me in and if I if I win you'll get percent yeah\
right and if I lose which poker's obviously very risky yeah then you know we get nothing yeah but yep yeah I mean\
that's a lot of what business really is like putting confidence into the right vehicle putting confidence into yourself\
knowing you're making the right decision so um that's I think what a lot of people are really looking for when they ask\
themselves well what do I do with the money right it's just really finding vehicles and I mean I'm a big believer\
you know just having been in business a long time now that like I mean you're either doing one of two\
things in my opinion one you're gonna go use it to start your own business like sure hey I'm gonna go fund you know the\
expenses of this business I'm starting I'm gonna go buy inventory I'm gonna go buy equipment and you know spend some\
money on ads and and everything else right and you know it's gonna be trial by air hopefully yeah you know we end up\
getting something that works and all that stuff right or to me um I think\
real estate is the way I mean man the more access you have to Capital and real estate the better it is and um\
we're always looking for more money in real estate yeah I think that just whatever means that is private money\
business credit personal credit I don't really care just just get more Capital because we know if we're good Real\
Estate Investors um it's just simply a game of debt you know the best Real Estate Investors are\
great at finding deals and operating but they're also equally great at finding ways to get more money yeah\
yeah totally yeah so I mean speaking of business I mean you just started this business a couple of years ago and I\
mean like you said at years old on the path to doing eight figures potentially\
um how the heck did you learn how to like just do all the other parts right like because credit is just right great I I\
learned the skill of how to get people more credit and help them and everything but you gotta know how to run the\
business of hiring people Marketing sales yeah no those are all like major\
components in the business I think one of the most important skills totally starts with communication right being\
able to communicate for all those different things like the messaging in your marketing the messaging in your sales right you know communicating with\
potential employees right it's definitely an important aspect you know to start with but I think I learned a\
lot of it just from having really good mentors early on you know when I first started no I got burned on a couple bag courses\
right and then eventually ran into someone I knew who would be a good Mentor for me and you know leverage zero\
percent interest credit to you know kind of move myself further along in the process and you know get access to\
mentorship to learn sales to learn marketing those things and um having some experience in the space\
as a you know High ticket closer myself working with other coaching companies\
really seeing the ins and outs of how they worked um you know like being affiliated with\
some people who've ran organizations with people like Grant Cardone right so\
you know being able to see like that org board being able to see you know all those different things and be able to\
learn from really good people you know I think it really really helped me be able to establish my business set\
up the systems properly in the beginning so now where you know in November we had maybe like myself my guy Paul my brother\
Joe and a VA now we've went from having a team of like the four of us to over \
people and just maybe like three months four months what's uh what's the future look like\
like what are the goals yeah I mean I want to keep adding more people into the machine I think I had like a realization\
in November you know I was doing this for myself right and I was just doing it on the small scale of you know I was\
doing all the sales I was doing all the marketing um I was doing all the Fulfillment right and I had to kind of think to myself\
like well you know obviously this is so great for me but I see how great it is for other\
people and like how many people do I really want to reach and I had to kind of break those limiting beliefs in\
myself and realize you know other people are capable and able of doing a lot of the responsibilities that I'm currently\
doing myself and you know really just focusing on delegating those tasks to\
other people I mean this is totally relevant even in the real estate space along your journey right to where you\
know delegating a lot of that work and learning how to do that and like writing down like everything that you're doing\
and handing it off to another person is such a valuable skill and such a valuable tool in your business because\
once you really nail that you can just keep doing it keep adding more people to the machine and then you know now you're\
kind of you know one business that's running itself you could start another business right another business after\
that so that's a lot of the things I think I'm looking toward doing is you know really building my funding program\
is great and as large large as it can be but also starting you know new Ventures New Opportunities maybe it could be\
something in real estate that's definitely something I'm looking a lot more into or maybe something in regards\
to like online marketing right or different kinds of projects that it seems like you've gotten involved with\
after you know getting involved with you know couch flipping real estate right so\
yeah I love it just a entrepreneur at heart and yeah I'll say this you know\
once you develop the skills to do marketing at a high level and sales at a high level and hire people and manage\
teams and and all that you know yeah you're right for for many things if you're staying kind of in the\
same like uh in this in this case the digital space um changing out the product is not that\
difficult you know it's like yeah there's a different deliverable now and\
you know there's different nuances to it but overall it's it's a very similar business yeah just having like those\
systems knowing what those systems are you know like learning how to you know develop an organization you know with\
different divisions and different responsibilities per division um I mean I think having that\
information to really start really helped me kind of go from you know where it was for me just kind of running this\
is some smaller kind of you know one-man job with you know a couple of friends\
helping me out to now we got like this organization that I think we were very\
prepared for just given the prior experience and training and people I'd met along the way to show me introduced\
me to this stuff yeah so on this uh next Endeavor for you I mean\
obviously you're you got a long ways to go still just continue to grow this this business and everything else and you're\
gonna scale that to wherever you know you see fit um on the investment side what are you\
looking at doing or do you think you're gonna start investing in real estate oh yeah definitely yeah yeah that's\
definitely I mean you know that's just a really great Market that's something that you know I mean people are always\
going to need a place to live people are always going to need office space right um I think it'll be really interesting\
over the next couple decades to see how things go with um commercial although it's still like a\
really hot Market where a lot of cash is made I mean people are always going to need a place to live right so I mean\
that's a that's a really good Market itself real estate um I think there's a lot of really\
interesting things happening online I think there's a lot of you know really stable businesses that can be you know\
ran and I think having a lot of this experience now growing my own Consulting\
business you know I think I'm going to be able to kind of transition into other things\
um with just the knowledge of sales marketing delegating responsibility how\
to manage an organization um you know understanding really this like seven division organization board\
yeah are you um the guy on the ads yeah nice yeah so you have to learn content\
and filming and stuff too yeah yeah you know I mean I just really used my phone I\
just you know went out on my patio and just you know took my phone out and you know just uh read off a teleprompter\
really um yeah but I knew what I wanted to say and you know I knew how I wanted to say it and you know didn't want to stumble\
or take hours to record it right but you know um but yeah those were all things that\
you know learned along the way you know all using zero percent interest funding or credit right to invest into those\
programs to learn how to reach yeah how to run ads cast a wider net help more\
people learn things that I've learned that helped me and other people so do you buy your own ads right now too oh\
yeah you do everything yourself oh yeah yeah I mean I've you know I have some help from you know one of my mentors who\
yeah you know dives into my ad account every now and then but I mean it's really simple to run once you get you\
know like all the you know important information right yeah like I filmed a\
bunch of ads but I've never never ran them no yeah no it's pretty\
it's pretty simple like running running YouTube ads and like learning how to do that I mean there's definitely more\
technicality I could probably get into but I mean you know it's probably like this too for\
you with uh like flipping houses or you know other aspects of different businesses right it's like a couple of\
very important things that you that you know that really make up like of what\
needs to be done um you know like it's like maybe like \
of things that you need to do that make up eighty percent of the revenue right so\
um but like knowing like what those things are like super important but yeah I do uh yeah I run my own YouTube ads I\
you know learn how to do sales all on my own learn how to run YouTube ads you\
know all with the help of mentors of course right so that's amazing well bro\
How To Build Business Credit Fast To Change Your Life!\
the paycheck the paycheck grind is tough\
and it's the biggest sign that you're\
stuck in the right race I remember\
working hours a week if not more and\
still feeling like I didn't have enough\
income to really be free and do what I\
wanted I definitely couldn't think about\
starting a business or getting into real\
estate because where would I get that\
kind of money from well the answer to\
that question and the fastest way that\
you're going to run up a bag is business\
credit today I'ma share with you how\
powerful business credit truly is and\
the steps that I follow to start getting\
business credit and using it to get back\
Where I Started\
my financial freedom and just a few\
years ago before I really knew what\
business credit was I was desperate to\
level up my life financially I mean I\
had a decent job but I just still wasn't\
happy because I didn't have any time or\
Financial Freedom in my life I really\
felt like I was spending most of my time\
working just to pay my rent my grocery\
and my main bills\
I was just at a point where I knew I\
wasn't going to be stuck in this Rat\
Race for the next Years and I wanted\
to make enough income to where I could\
really do what I wanted to do and was at\
this point when a friend of mine\
actually started putting me on to what\
business credit was and how to start\
building it and after this was when\
everything changed and the crazy thing\
is I'm actually headed to the bank right\
now to get some funds ready for upcoming\
real estate transaction and I promise\
you none of this was possible until I\
really started understanding what\
business credit was not only do I use\
business credit to invest in things like\
real estate but I've also used it to\
invest in assets like vehicles for my\
Toro business\
and this is possible because all\
What Is Business Credit?\
business credit technically is is money\
or funding given to a business entity\
intended to increase its cash flow and\
help it grow now this fun day can come\
in different forms whether it's a credit\
card which I use to purchase my Toro\
cars a line of credit which is as close\
to cash as you can get or outright\
business loan all of these options are\
technically forms of business credit now\
there are also a few financial\
institutions who give out business\
credit a few of them being Credit Unions\
Banks and actual credit card companies\
man in the beginning I'm telling you I\
barely even knew about my personal\
credit let alone my business credit but\
this was when things really started to\
ramp up for me so the business credit\
Business vs. Personal\
side is obviously different than the\
personal Credit One of the biggest\
differences being the actual credit\
reporting company the business side\
still has companies like Equifax and\
Experian but they're more tailored to\
businesses but the new player in the\
business credit game is going to be duns\
and Bradstreet now just take note of\
dungeon Bradstreet because I'm gonna\
revisit this a little bit later because\
they're super important when it comes to\
business credit another big difference\
was the actual score range of the two\
different in credit scores we all know\
like around the is a good personal\
credit score but when it comes to\
business there's a whole different scale\
of numbers so at this point I was\
definitely super excited and intrigued\
to start learning more about business\
and seeing how it was a whole different\
ball game being played on the business\
side but honestly I was still kind of\
lost at how I was going to use business\
credit to actually change my life\
financially\
[Music]\
thank you\
and this feeling is what triggered me to\
start looking at a business credit even\
more and really start realizing how\
powerful it truly was first off when it\
Why Business Credit Is Essential\
comes to business credit lenders usually\
give three to five times higher the\
credit limit on business credit cards as\
they would a personal credit card the\
second thing is that business credit\
separates your business from your\
personal finances most business credit\
doesn't even report to your personal\
credit score and that's super powerful\
because that literally gives you the\
freedom to make those moves with your\
Business Without Really worrying about\
the negative impacts on your personal\
side and it speaks to probably one of\
the biggest reasons on why business\
credit is important to changing your\
life and it's the ability to leverage\
this business credit into income\
producing assets\
this means you can invest in assets that\
you just normally wouldn't have the cash\
for up front being able to invest in\
things like a Toro business investing\
into real estate or just being able to\
invest and start that business you\
didn't have the upfront money for\
business credit is going to be the\
easiest way for you to get your hands on\
thousands of dollars if you started from\
the bottom coming from where I come from\
the only way to get your hand on four or\
five figures of upfront capital is that\
either you know somebody die and leave\
you inheritance or you get lucky and hit\
the lottery other than that your chances\
are slim so with that being said let me\
know in the comments what you're going\
to use your business credit to invest in\
so at this point you know I was\
motivated and ready to start building\
some business credit on my own and if\
you're excited to run your own business\
credit back up make sure you like this\
video And subscribe to the channel so we\
can push this channel out to more back\
chases like yourself and grow our wealth\
together so like many of you watching I\
still at this point didn't know exactly\
how to build my own business credit and\
I definitely didn't know how to get\
business credit from financial\
institutions like this and I know it's\
easy for you to feel stuck right now\
because you're getting all this\
information and you might not know\
exactly where to start you might not\
have a whole bunch of money to start\
with or the best personal credit but the\
fact that you're still here tells me\
that you're smart you're serious and\
you're ready to make a change so make\
The Business Credit Blueprint\
sure you follow these next steps to the\
T because this is literally going to be\
the blueprint for you running up\
thousands of dollars in business credit\
now the first thing that you need to do\
is actually create your business and not\
just create the business but actually\
set it up the right way from the very\
beginning so that your business looks\
all the way official on paper and this\
is the time you want to get your notepad\
ready because these gems you want to\
keep handy so you don't stumble through\
the process like I did when I first\
started out now actually creating your\
business is pretty simple you can go\
ahead and form your business like your\
llc at your Secretary of State website\
and for Most states you can literally\
fill out the business application in \
to minutes all online the price\
performing your business is usually\
between to depending on what\
state you're in but honestly it pales in\
minuscule compared to what we're going\
to do with this now actually going\
through the process of creating your\
business as I said is really easy but if\
you want a little bit more help I'm\
gonna actually link my own DIY LLC guy\
in the description below and that's\
going to walk you through the process\
step by step and give you the templates\
that you need as far as starting your\
business next thing we want to do is go\
ahead and get our Ein this is our\
employer identification number and we\
can get this at the IRS website site\
which is irs.gov your EIN is really\
important because it's pretty much like\
your business's Social Security number\
so this is going to be how all the\
businesses that you do business with and\
the lenders pretty much keep track of\
your business itself as I said this part\
is completely free all you have to do is\
go to irs.gov and start your EIN\
application\
now the next hack that you want to do is\
go ahead and actually get your business\
an official business an address and you\
can do this through getting something\
called a virtual office now the cool\
thing about a virtual office is that\
it's actually a big corporate building\
that will allow you to use their address\
as your business address so that they\
can pick up mail for you and ultimately\
it's going to make your business look\
super official so when these lenders go\
ahead and look up and Google Map your\
business address it's going to be a\
super official office building and as I\
said when you get mail the Virtual\
Office clerk will actually pick up the\
mail for you until you pick it up or you\
can pay an additional fee and have that\
mail sent directly to you once they\
receive it now the business that I use\
for my Virtual Office is called Regis I\
love Regis because they're not too\
pricey but they give you all this\
awesome stuff you know mail pickup and a\
nice office that you can come into when\
you come into this building it's just a\
whole vibe you got glass offices\
everywhere everything looks professional\
and for you as a business owner this is\
just another step that signifies that\
you're making your way to be an official\
business and that much closer to go\
ahead and locking in thousands of\
dollars with business credit now the\
next thing I want you to get for your\
business is a toll-free number so this\
is just like an number or a separate\
phone line specifically for your\
business so that way when lenders go\
ahead and call and look up your business\
it's not just your personal cell phone\
it's an actual direct line to your\
business and in the same light you also\
want to go ahead and get your business a\
domain and a business email address so\
the domain is just essentially the.com\
name for your business go to GoDaddy and\
get this for just about is super easy\
and when you get that.com you can also\
register that.com as a business email so\
this is another way to make your\
business stand out and look really\
official because when you go ahead and\
put your email address it's not a Gmail\
it's not a Yahoo address it should be\
something similar to like your name or\
info at yourbusinessname.com and once\
you get the domain go ahead and lock in\
that business email and make this part\
of your business legit as well so we're\
just about there doing all these things\
creating your business you're really\
structuring it so it looks official and\
that these lenders will really give you\
the business credit that you asked for\
but you'll get bonus points if you do\
this next step I actually want you to\
use that domain and go ahead and create\
a website for your business it doesn't\
have to be a fancy multi thousand dollar\
website it can literally just be a\
one-page website with your business\
address your business phone number and a\
brief description of your business just\
so once again when these lenders go to\
look you up you also have an online\
presence and there's a website that they\
can go to that represents your business\
now you have a legit business you're\
looking Aand you've really checked off\
most of the boxes that you need to to\
run up this business credit back it's\
just a few more things I want you to\
know before you get these tens of\
Relationship Banking\
thousands of dollars now it's time for\
you to complete one of the most\
important of them all and that's getting\
a business checking account and you see\
me earlier at Navy Federal Credit Union\
and that's one of my favorite financial\
institutions and a great place maybe for\
you to start with opening your first\
business checking account now this is a\
huge part of your process because a lot\
of financial institutions don't even\
recognize your business as being forms\
until you actually open your business\
bank account and if you're just starting\
out I would recommend you opening your\
business account with a credit union as\
opposed to a big Commercial Bank because\
credit unions are usually a little bit\
smaller and more open to start in that\
business credit relationship as opposed\
to a big Commercial Bank so with this\
being said if you start somewhere like\
Navy Fed I want you to go ahead and get\
a personal check-in and savings account\
as well as your business check-in and\
savings account to build that\
relationship even more from the start if\
you have a direct deposit coming from\
your nine to five go ahead and move that\
over to Navy Fed as well we're just\
going to start building more and more\
elements of that relationship so that\
Navy Fed is going to be a little bit\
more lenient when you go to action for\
that bag and business credit and the\
crazy part is once we do these things\
and actually show the credit union that\
we have skin in the game we could be\
ready to go and apply for a business\
credit card as soon as a few weeks to a\
few months in some instances you can\
open up the business bank account and\
apply for the business credit card at\
the same day and get approved now just\
think about running this same play at\
multiple Banks multiple times this is\
easy blueprint right to a hundred\
thousand in business credit so this\
specific method of building your\
business credit directly with a credit\
union or financial institution is called\
relationship banking I like this method\
because it can be really fast and it can\
get you high credit limits but most of\
the time when you use a relationship\
banking method they are going to require\
you to do a PG a PG stands for a\
personal guarantor which is just\
essentially you co-signing for your\
business so even though you're still\
using a PG and co-signing for your\
business in this method most of these\
institutions don't report your credit\
order utilization on your business side\
to your personal credit report so with\
that being said there's absolutely\
nothing wrong with doing a PG and doing\
relationship banking to run up business\
credit as well it can be very fast you\
can literally get into the game with\
like a mid credit score but even if\
your personal credit isn't there yet\
The Tier Method\
there's still other options that you can\
use to start building your business\
credit now this method I like to call\
the tier method and it's going to\
involve duns and Bradstreet if you\
remember from earlier I told you dungeon\
Bradstreet is a major player in business\
this credit and this is where they come\
in so now I want you to go ahead and go\
to dnb.com and apply for a dungeon brass\
Street number once again dungeon\
Bradstreet is actually the biggest\
business credit reporting Bureau and you\
can go ahead and sign up to get a number\
with them absolutely free when you go to\
dmv.com I will tell you they're going to\
try to sell you on a bunch of packages\
at first these are things you don't\
really need to get a business credit or\
a paydex score with them so go ahead and\
Skip through that not only is this duns\
and Bradstreet number going to pretty\
much track your business credit score\
but they're also going to report the\
transactions and relationships that\
you're building with other vendors and\
other Merchants as you start to build\
your business credit and speaking of\
vendor and Merchant accounts the next\
step in the tier method is actually to\
start building direct relationships with\
these vendor accounts and these other\
Merchants now these vendor accounts are\
actually businesses that will allow you\
to buy from them and invoice you \
or days later and let you pay\
overtime now what this does is report\
those business transactions as you pay\
them on time as active trade lines to\
dungeon Bradstreet and these net s net\
s and net s become your first trade\
lines as you start to build your\
business credit now there are a whole\
bunch of net and net companies out\
there but in my past experience the most\
reliable ones that I know report\
directly to dungeon Bradstreet and the\
other business credit bureaus are going\
to be quill\
Uline and Granger these three companies\
are pretty much office supply companies\
so you can use them to go ahead and buy\
individual things for your company you\
may not need everything that they sell\
but you can definitely find something to\
get that relationship started and have\
them start reporting to dungeon\
Bradstreet on your business's behalf now\
when you first start the relationship\
with these vendors you may not be able\
to buy on invoice and net on your\
very first purchase but all you have to\
do is spend between like and in\
your first time in cash and then after\
that they'll invoice you and allow you\
to pay overtime and report that trade\
line right thereafter and the more you\
Paydex Score\
do business with these vendors the more\
trade lines they'll report to duns and\
Bradstreet and the faster you'll\
actually generate your business credit\
score which is called a paydex score so\
after you've built strong relationships\
with these vendor accounts now you're\
ready for the next step which\
essentially is applying for gas card and\
store cards but the fact that you have\
some net s on your profile now you can\
go to places like shell Chevron and\
Sunoco and you can actually apply to be\
given a gas card these are cars that you\
can use up front and pay back over time\
and these businesses are going to report\
them to your business credit bureau and\
not only can you get gas cards at this\
time but you can get your first entry\
into actually getting store cards some\
of the first stores you can apply to for\
business credit cards during the Tyrant\
method are going to be places like Sam's\
Club Costco Walmart and even Amazon has\
started getting into the store cards and\
granting new businesses business credit\
and now don't you have your vendor\
account you have your gas cards and your\
store accounts you're ready to play with\
the big boys and you can actually start\
applying for commercial credit card\
companies like American Express Chase\
and more and you can literally do all\
these things in just a matter of a few\
months now another gym is the best way\
that you can monitor your steps as you\
take this business credit journey is to\
actually download the nav app that's nav\
and pretty much it's the Credit Karma of\
business credit you just download it to\
your phone you put in your business\
information and then they'll start to\
show you the business transactions and\
credit reporting data that they have on\
you nav also has a paid plan that will\
act as a trade line if you sign up for\
the monthly subscription but if you\
don't want to pay for your monthly\
subscription just yet you can still get\
your normal business credit reporting\
data just from the free plan on the app\
too overall as I said all these things\
are just going to help you get your\
paydex score generated and once you get\
that paid X score it's game time after\
following these same exact steps I was\
able to build over a hundred thousand\
dollars in business credit and stop\
living paycheck to paycheck I use\
business credit to start my Toro\
business to start investing in real\
estate and to continue to change the\
people's lives around me and now it's\
time for you to take this information\
and start running up your own bag with\
business credit\
a what banks don\'92t want you to know\
what if I told you that every time your\
property is repossessed there is a\
secret IRS form that proves the lender\
may have already been paid now in this\
video I'm going to break down the A\
form how it connects to repossession i'm\
also going to be talking about why it\
should be your hidden weapon for a debt\
discharge strategy i've studied consumer\
law UCCC codes and federal tax forms to\
help you understand what the banks don't\
want you to know before we dive into\
this video this is not legal advice this\
is not financial advice this is only for\
educational purposes only you dig what\
I'm saying so make sure you stay all the\
way to the end because what we're going\
to be talking about is going to empower\
you to start doing things like\
challenging debt collectors discharging\
your debt but also at the same time\
being willing to hold these companies\
accountable and expose these companies\
okay now if you're brand new hit the\

in so that we can be at the top of the\
algorithm and they can see content just\
like this so don't be afraid to hit that\
like button let's hit likes on this\
video and we will continue to drop more\
game on s okay now what we're going\
to be talking about is the A\
okay and how it pertains to debt\
discharge we're going to talk about the\
strategy behind using the A\
the truth behind it we're going to talk\
about the different what each box means\
within the how this ties to debt\
discharge and a strategy to use this in\
consumer law so make sure you stay all\
the way to the end because we're going\
to be talking about these forms in\
particular as it pertains to discharging\
debt and essentially debunking any myth\
or any mystique behind discharging debt\
What is a a\
now let's dive straight in what is a\
A okay a A\
is filed when a lender takes back\
property whether it's foreclosure or\
repossession okay it is typically\
required by the IRS for debt write offs\
okay it starts the discharge process you\
just never get told now typically what\
happens is if they repossess your\
vehicle or the house they must report it\
to the IRS and that's your paper trail\
to to notify you that the debt has been\
discharged so when we go to exactly what\
the A looks like it's the\
acquisition or abandonment of secured\
property okay so typically what happens\
is uh when you file a A so to break\
this down into plain language the A\
stands for acquisition or abandonment of\
secure property and it tells the IRS\
what happened to a debt that was tied to\
a property like a car house or equipment\
so what it means if you see a A a\
A doesn't cancel the debt on its own\
but it reveals that the lender either\
acquired the property meaning they took\
ownership like in repossession or\
foreclosure or number two they recorded\
the abandonment meaning you gave it up\
or lost possession and they claimed it\
as a loss or reclaimed it so here's the\
key insight if the lender acquires or\
repossess the vehicle and they report\
the fair market value and balance owed\
on the A that means the original\
known loan has been severed from the\
collateral okay and the debt now becomes\
a separate accounting matter possibly\
taxable possibly sent to collections or\
even eventually forgiven and reported on\
a C cancellation of debt so here's\
what it reveals that the property is no\
longer yours that's number one number\
two that the lender took action on the\
debt number three that they have written\
off the property on their books and\
number four that they must report this\
to the IRS for tax and accounting\
reasons so typically if your vehicle\
gets repossessed you should receive a\
A copy B which is this okay it says\
for the borrower now you can use the\
A as a part of the paper trail to\
essentially prove that the lender\
already took their remedy the asset is\
no longer yours and number three that\
the debt has changed form often\
signaling\
discharge offset or assignment now if\
something gets discharged if something\
gets offseted that right there\
essentially means that there is you are\
not you don't have the obligation to pay\
the debt i mean you never did from the\
beginning but let's just break down the\
aspect of the different types of things\
when you are looking at the okay so\
when you look at the box one is\
going to talk about the date of\
acquisition or abandonment so obviously\
you know uh uh for in this case it could\
particularly be when they repossess the\
vehicle when they foreclose or whatever\
the case may be they're going to put it\
here number two is going to talk about\
the balance owed okay this is all for\
accounting okay this is what accounting\
is number four is going to be the fair\
market value whatever the amount of the\
vehicle is or or home or whatever the\
case may be is going to go here number\
five were you personally liable and this\
is typically important they may check\
this off they may not check this off\
okay in the very beginning you you're\
taught that you can use the A and\
you know you can fill this out on your\
own now you can do that but you will\
have to come from the perspective that\
you were the one that are that was\
lending the money and also at the same\
time you will have to come from the\
perspective and essentially prove that\
they are not the lender okay you also\
have to prove that you are a you are in\
the lending business you are a financial\
institution if you are going to use a\
A now here's the way to use this\
properly okay it's best if you use this\
properly if you are going to use this\
against them like if they're already\
going to file this on your behalf use\
this against them if they try to still\
collect on a debt or or a vehicle or\
whatever the case may be and they file\
the A just know that that right\
there is the start of them discharging\
debt okay so let's just talk about how\
this um\
you know uh uh uh let's talk about how\
this is going to be used in debt\
discharge now when we go to box five it\
says check if the borrower was\
personally liable for repayment of the\
debt if the box is no okay so if they if\
if they don't check this off then that\
means that the lender cannot come after\
you for the debt so it's important for\
you to get the so that you can be\
able to to the copy B so you can see how\
they filled it out and you know what\
course of action you should take okay\
now here's how this ties to debt\
discharge on the A side this\
acknowledges that the debt is in the\
termination status okay knowing that the\
debt is being terminated further shows\
you that the debt has already been made\
whole and a lot of times what they do is\
after you pay or after they repossess\
your vehicle they attempt to collect on\
the debt even more okay typically what\
What happens after a a\
happens after a A a C comes\
through to follow through with a full\
cancellation this is something else that\
you will also need to have full\
disclosure of if it happens this is what\
a charge off is now these forms are\
evidence for administrative remedy or a\
legal defense towards one that is\
attempting to discharge debt use a\
tender payment or better yet offsetting\
and settling their debts because the\
argument is is that hey the debt has\
already been paid for the debt has\
already been settled and you cannot\
double collect okay i'm not liable for a\
debt that you've already been paid okay\
so after they repossess your vehicle\
they'll try to file lawsuits and this\
that and the third for the remaining\
balance but they get paid out the fair\
market value of the vehicle no matter\
what so IRS forms can show that the debt\
has already been handled even if\
collectors keep chasing you okay so\
that's how you would use this okay some\
people use it or you know we use in\
aspect where they fill out the form\
whatever the case may be but if you just\
wait for them to fill out the form wait\
for them to charge off the debt quote\
unquote then you can use that against\
them okay and now you don't even have to\
make it an argument about you know you\
being the lender or you being the holder\
in due course or whatever the case may\
be it's now them making an argument that\
they are who they say they are are they\
the ones that are the holder in due\
course are they the ones uh being lawful\
or are they trying to double collect\
okay so then we dive into the strategic\
use when it comes to consumer laws so\
first things first you want to use the\
asking of the copy B in your debt\
validation response if they come after\
you for the debt you want to send them a\
I mean you want to send them a fair\
a debt validation letter according to\
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\
under USC G\
okay and essentially what it it says is\
what USC G it gives you the it\
pretty much gives you the right to\
validate debts and part of the\
validation of debts and through the\
FDCPA\
they must proi provide all the\
disclosures that pertains to the debts\
including the disclosures that\
discharges the debt okay including the\
accounting ledgers including you know uh\
uh if there was a A or C that\
was you know created or filed on your\
behalf this is the type of information\
that they should be giving you when you\
validate that not just the original\
wedding ink signature and if you do get\
their original wedding in signature\
right it should be an authenticated copy\
not just a photocopy an authenticated\
copy has been notorized okay somebody\
beared witness to them making a copy of\
the original note okay number two you\
can request full accounting under\
UCCC-\
under UCCC-we talked about this\
yesterday-\
where you have a right to essentially\
request accounting\
regarding a list of collateral or\
statement of accounts so request means\
record of a type described in paragraph\
three and four request for accounting\
means record authenticated by dep de\
deptor requesting that the recipient\
provide accounting of the unpaid\
obligation secured by collateral and\
reasonably identifying the transaction\
or relationship that is subject to the\
request very detailed request regarding\
a list of collateral means a record\
authenticated by a deptor requesting\
that the recipient approve or correct\
the list of what the deptor believes to\
be the collateral securing an obligation\
and reasonably identifying the\
transaction or rel or relationship that\
is subject to the request number four\
request regarding statement of account\
means a record authenticated by a debtor\
requesting the that the recipient\
approve or correct a statement\
indicating what the depthor believes to\
be the aggregate amount of unpaid\
balances secured by the collateral okay\
here's what it says in B duty to respond\
to requests okay it says subject to\
subsections C D E and F a secured party\
other than a buyer of accounts cattle\
paper payment intangibles promisary note\
co-signer shall comply with the request\
within days of the receipt so they\
have days to respond okay so you have\
a right to ask for this and it says here\
in on the for the record in the\
constitution that they have days to\
respond and that it is their duty okay\
no matter what they should be able to\
provide these disclosures as in regards\
to the accounting okay you can also\
combine with a conditional acceptance a\
conditional acceptance essentially is\
going to a conditional acceptance is\
essentially saying "Hey I'm willing to\
prove if you can prove X Y and Z then I\
rock with you." Okay then I will all\
Conditional acceptance\
right so if I just pull up a little\
language of what a conditional\
acceptance will look like and this is\
for my people if you got this far hit\
the like button hit the subscribe button\
if you're brand new now for conditional\
acceptance it says "Hey I hereby\
conditionally accept your offer to\
collect payment on alleged account\
referenced above upon your presentation\
of the following documentation." So look\
a verified copy of your original wedding\
signature or contract showing my\
signature verified authenticated proof\
that you are a lawful holder in due\
course of said instrument according to\
UCCC -full accounting and\
transaction ledger showing the origin of\
the debt and all payments and\
adjustments made under DC-\
okay legal proof that valuable\
consideration was given by your\
institution or client in exchange for\
the original note proof that the alleged\
debt has not been discharged sold\
satisfied through tax write off\
insurance or any third-party settlement\
and a copy of the C and the A\
if applicable confirmation that you're\
in compliance with USC G and\
USC affirmation that no third\
party debt collector is misrepresenting\
their standing in violation of the\
federal law so I'm very strategic and\
very um detailed on the type of\
questions that I'm asking and now they\
should be answering these point for\
point they can't answer these point for\
point then that's when the that's when\
they fall in the burden place okay\
that's where they get in a position\
where now look you know I don't give a\
heck if you just show me this but I need\
you to prove that you're the lawful\
holder in due course i need you to\
provide the full accounting and\
transaction ledger i need legal proof\
that their valuable consideration was\
given meaning that you actually loaned\
me money from your institution okay i\
need to also know that it hasn't been\
discharged and if you have a C or\
A then that affirms that there it\
has been discharged if you can show me\
that it hasn't been sold or securitized\
right these are the things that you have\
to show me because you know by law if\
it's already been written off if you\
already made money on it then you\
shouldn't be collecting you can't\
collect you forfeit your ability to\
collect once you sell the note once you\
sell the note you actually lose the\
being the lawful holder okay so that's\
why I'm asking for the accounting and\
things of that nature and that's just\
that's how powerful conditional\
acceptance is but you know sometimes we\
think that the argument is literally\
just about oh I filled out this form and\
this that and the third no do you see\
the list of questions that I'm breaking\
down\
you dig what I'm saying now obviously\
you can go and you can copy and paste\
and you can go review this multiple\
times but I do have it in my complete\
debt guide the link is in the\
description okay now you essentially\
want to ask things like did the lender\
file for insurance is this a tax\
deduction you be very specific of the\
type of things that you ask which is why\
my conditional acceptance is laid out\
that way and that's where it's like okay\
you cannot miss a beat okay now here's\
how you're going to really close this\
strategy number one you want to track\
these forms on your IRS account\
transcript okay number two you want to\
request the missing ones using the\
Freedom of Information Act or a direct\
IRS request you can ask the IRS directly\
for a particular um uh uh uh uh uh you\
know for the to track these forms and\
get the IRS transcript and you want to\
compare who profited the lender the\
collector the IRS write off because at\
the end of the day if somebody made\
money off of the note that they are\
claiming that they are the ones where\
you owe if they was able to make money\
off of that it puts them in a position\
to where they cannot say that you never\
really gave them something of value like\
you just agreed to a term but be upfront\
and tell me that my agreeance or me\
signing that created an obligation that\
obligation is a financial asset to you\
if you were just upfront about that we\
wouldn't be going down this rigma road\
right now and I'm and I'm not saying\
this so that one could get emotional and\
things of that nature but it's more in\
the aspect of you know when you start to\
to challenge their honor and they move\
in dishonor that right there is a\
violation moving in dishonor simply is\
just giving you uh uh the wrong\
information moving in dishonor can be\
essentially them giving you false\
information moving in dishonor can\
essentially be be uh them ignoring you\
okay not answering point for point right\
not taking your lawful tender right they\
will say "Well oh it's not legal\
tender." But I mean when you look at the\
definition of tender\
you dig what I'm saying boom it says\
Tender\
that tender is to unconditionally offer\
money or performance to meet an\
obligation so when you think about it\
you are always unconditionally offering\
money you are always performing to meet\
an obligation that's when you send when\
you send a unconditional offer or a\
conditional offer or a conditional\
acceptance you are performing to meet an\
obligation see we don't look at that as\
simple as that we try to over complicate\
it and think we got to fill this form\
and that form and we got to have this\
set up and that set up but if you can\
prove that you were performing on the\
obligation they can't say that you\
breached the the contract okay but then\
on the other foot if they refuse it it\
says that under UCCC -that if a\
tender a payment of the obligation to\
pay an instrument is made to a person\
entitled to enforce the instrument and\
the tender is refused then there is\
discharge\
okay so these are the things that you\
would include in your debt validation\
letter these are the things that you\
would include in your conditional\
acceptance letter these are the things\
that when you start to challenge them\
and you ask them for particular\
information especially when we're\
talking about a strategy of a A you\
ask them for it hey do you have the copy\
B do you have the copy uh uh B of the\
C or the A for my records and\
there's nothing wrong with that if it\
was if if it was something that was not\
would be uh detrimental to them then\
they would just give it to you if it\
wasn't so detrimental to them it's Noah\
I can't give that to you that would be\
false and misleading information and\
according to USC under the truth\
and lending act it says that they will\
Criminal Liability\
be under criminal liability for willful\
and knowing violation\
so if they give false or inaccurate\
information or fails to provide\
information which he is required to\
disclose under the provisions of the\
subchapter right or otherwise fails to\
comply with any requirement imposed\
under the subchapter shall be fined not\
more than five grand or imprisoned so\
it's now a criminal offense if they lie\
about the stuff that we're we're asking\
for well you can't give it to me okay\
let me take your name and your number\
because it's actually a criminal offense\
for you to willful willfully and\
knowingly violate my rights by lying\
giving me false information when you\
start to throw these things out at them\
that right there puts them in a in a\
position where now they have they're\
they're caught red-handed and it's like\
damn should I tell the truth should I\
hang up on them and if they do stuff\
like that then you This is why we always\
ask for them to send it in writing try\
not to have these conversations over the\
phone because if they lie in writing you\
can bring present that in court oh you\
can't send it to me can you send me that\
in writing\
i would love to get that in writing if\
they decide not to send it in writing\
then that's when you want to send them a\
letter and ask them for it in writing\
look I spoke to this agent and and I\
asked them um they this agent said that\
they couldn't provide this information\
to me and that I don't think that that's\
true i know that under the truth and\
lending act i know that under the FDCPA\
i know that under the UCCC that you guys\
have a duty to provide this information\
to me okay and just in case this person\
may have had it wrong I'm giving you\
guys an opportunity to provide that\
information in writing right if you're\
going to say that you can't give it to\
me I would love to see that in writing\
okay and I want you to know that if you\
lie under USC you cannot give me\
false and misleading information that\
would be a criminal offense okay that\
would be a a level of fraud all right\
that would be you dishonoring me okay\
and then furthermore if you ignore this\
attempt you'll be violating the FDCPA\
okay USC \
okay so part of understanding these laws\
is so that you know they can't just take\
advantage of you and give you some BS by\
saying "Oh we can't give you that." Yeah\
if you can't give me that right under \
Civil Liability\
USC K they'll be under civil\
liability okay it says except as\
otherwise provided in this section any\
debt collector who fails to comply with\
any provisions of the subchapter with\
respect to any person is liable to such\
person in an amount equal to the sum of\
any actual damage sustained by such\
person as a result of such failure in\
the case of any action by individual\
such in such additional damages as the\
court may allow not exceeding a thousand\
or in the case of a class action okay so\
long story short if and this is what\
this is saying that if they violate any\
of these sections of the Fair Debt\
Collection Practices Act even as simple\
as them not validating your debt and\
ignoring your validation attempt them\
you know giving you false and misleading\
representation them using harassment or\
abuse them not communicating in\
connection with the debt properly them\
acquiring your location information um\
giving it to a third party without your\
consent you uh them furnishing deceptive\
forms you have a right to challenge\
their liability on that because they\
have a duty to do that so not only do\
you have USC K but you also have\
USC all right so all in all if\
they repossess your vehicle if they\
foreclose on your home just know a A\
was created you want to get record of\
that A and know that after a A a\
C is going to follow dig what I'm\
saying this is how you use a to be\
able to discharge debt you use it\
against them you create a strategy you\
use that paper trail to prove that the\
debt has already been settled okay we\
can argue that that you know the\
promisary note may pay the bill but if\
that if you're not strong in that\
argument cuz I do I will tell you that\
that does take a understanding of what's\
happening behind the scenes but if\
you're not if you get a A or C\
just know that the debt has been\
discharged they cannot double collect\
they forfeit their their hope them being\
the holder in due course and you use\
that against them you say "Hey the debt\
has already been discharged so you can't\
collect on this debt if you already made\
your money on it."\
Okay and that's what the argument is\
whatever you agree to becomes null and\
void\
okay so their only argument is to\
enforce the agreement but if that\
agreement has been settled already\
because some third party decided to pay\
the debt or you decided to charge it off\
there are laws put in place so that you\
can be able to fight against someone who\
is not the legal holder in due course\
someone that's already made money\
someone who hasn't given value\
consideration that's according to the\
debt and they still try to come after\
you for some debt all right so now that\
you guys understand exactly how these\
forms go how to properly um\
challenge them if you get in a position\
where your car gets repossessed or the\
house and this is typically after it\
gets repossessed or after the house gets\
foreclosed on you now know that there\
are secret IRS forms that they use okay\
and we've learned to fill out these\
forms ourselves but no you can actually\
just use you go based off of what they\
fill out already and use it against them\
okay so if you gotten this far down\
below I have the complete debt guide\
that pretty much has uh instructions\
letters like the conditional acceptance\
the threepack affidavits affidavit of\
truth debt validation letter where I'm\
asking these key questions that go\
handinhand with discharging your debt\
A \
Navy Federal Employee Tells Me How to Get Internal Score\
\'a0how\
to get a a perfect internal Navy\
Federal credit score and if you don't\
know what an internal uh score is with\
Navy Federal we're going to talk about\
that but um it's just recently I\
released a video on how to get an\
$credit card the flagship with\
Navy Federal on that video I talk about\
a strategy that anyone can use whether\
your credit is good whether your credit\
is bad it's a strategy that you\
basically use in do things that\
essentially increase your internal score\
now when you increase your internal\
score it gives you a better chance of\
getting products and services with Navy\
Federal because they don't just consider\
your personal FICO nine TransUnion score\
or whatever scoring mile that they're\
using because they also use Experian for\
the business side it doesn't really\
matter um it matters but it's like in\
conjunction with that you also have this\
internal score that really is based on\
the things that you do with them okay so\
it's like you don't just have to rely on\
just having a super high credit score\
like a and just think that the doors\
just open for you and you can get\
everything um recently one of our\
subscribers he just and I think I pinned\
that actual comment that he uh made he\
had a credit score and was able to\
get\
$for a Flagship credit card with\
Navy Federal now that doesn't mean that\
his personal credit may not his personal\
credit score may not have been high but\
maybe he had no derogatory marks and he\
was in the process of rebuilding but\
maybe it it looked like this could have\
potential and then maybe he did some\
things with that strategy in order to\
put himself in position to get a high\
internal score so even with having a low\
credit score or bad credit he was able\
to still get a very high credit limit\
and a very good credit card so that's\
why this is important that's the reason\
why I'm excited to share this\
information and why I think that you\
know everyone should Implement these\
things if they can in order to increase\
their internal score with Navy Federal\
whether you're a member or whether you\
are planning to become a member in the\
future so you know let's get started\
with these things that I actually\
learned while I was at Navy Federal\
DD+Flagship Checking Account\
first thing something I did mention in\
the video but I did get more information\
on and why it was important so for Navy\
Federal Direct Deposit um and having\
that Flagship the checking account now I\
talked about this in that same video but\
I want to give more information on how\
this actually will increase your\
internal score so stability and\
predictability this is a really big\
thing with Navy Federal and this kind of\
works with all financial institutions\
other credit unions Banks um direct\
deposit it provides a stable and\
predictable source of funds when a uh\
when when a customer uh has a paycheck\
or other forms of in come when it's\
directly deposited into your bank\
account it ensures a regular flow of\
money into that bank recently I did\
another video on how to set up um or how\
to create paycheck stubs but also how to\
set up direct deposit if you're\
self-employed so now I pay myself\
through my business I just got an email\
seriously like right before I made this\
video I got an email saying that my cash\
Rewards Card my um cash back increased\
from %\
to\
% because I have direct deposit\
again so they're recognizing the the\
deposit that I'm making through my\
business as my direct deposit so if\
you're someone who's self-employed or\
has a business and you wonder how you\
can do this I have a video on that as\
well again if you have a question I'm\
just trying to make sure that for any\
type\
of any I don't know how else to call it\
but any excuse or anything that you\
think can prevent you from doing\
something I want to have a counter to to\
that argument because I really do\
believe that if you have as if you stop\
making excuses and reasons why you can't\
you'll see that there's plenty of\
solutions the solutions are everywhere\
they're they're infinite you just have\
to change your mindset so even if you're\
self-employed you can do this\
too now it's reduced cost so direct\
deposit actually reduces the cost\
associated with handling paper checks\
with Navy Federal and it saves money on\
printing processing mailing um when\
members opt into this so Navy Federal\
likes to see that because it will save\
the money and it helps streamline their\
operations so it does reduce expenses\
all of this stuff is very very important\
when you want to increase your internal\
score um retention so when they offer\
this it retains customers because\
normally when you have your direct\
deposit with an institution you're very\
rarely going to go somewhere else what's\
cool is you can have a direct deposit\
for a small amount and you could spread\
your direct your deposit among many\
banks so most of your jobs will have\
this where if you go into like you know\
workday Workforce whatever it is that\
that you're using you can actually\
disperse your deposit into many\
different banks essentially you will\
still have the direct deposit feature so\
just know that it's not like you have to\
only do this with one place you can\
spread it amongst a bunch of other Banks\
so just be aware that that's something\
that that you can do um it increases the\
engagement so it encourages members to\
engage more with their bank account uh\
when members have income that's going\
directly into their Bank they're more\
likely to use other products and\
services like Bill Pay savings accounts\
and other features um and as of now\
they're actually offering a special\
savings with the free Flagship checking\
account if you have an average daily\
balance of\
$or more $if you have less than\
so just by knowing that you can\
see that Navy Federal is incentivizing\
members to maintain a certain balance in\
their account and this will increase\
your internal score significantly so\
these are all reasons why having that is\
super important and why you want to\
enroll in this even if you're only going\
to do a partial enrollment I recommend\
doing that and if you can at least uh\
maintain an average daily balance of\
$it'll save you the $for for the\
flagship having that Premier tier\
account does also help so if you can do\
that uh let's move on to the next thing\
Pledge Loans\
now let's talk about the pledge loan now\
with the pledge loan and you may know\
this too I have a video on this if you\
want an in-depth um review on the pledge\
loan how it works how it helps I\
recommend that you watch that video as\
well I'll probably link them at the end\
so you utilize your Navy Federal play\
pledge loan to boost your credit score\
lots of people have been doing this it\
can increase your score seems to be an\
average of to points this strategy\
involves depositing anywhere from\
$all the way up to\
$initiating a pledge loan a\
secured loan and then paying off %\
either immediately or you can wait a\
month for it to report that's your\
choice this method diversifies your\
credit\
portfolio so when you have your credit\
profile\
this um will give you a good credit mix\
it'll also show that you can handle\
large amounts of loans and that you're\
paying them back on time it also will\
increase your credit score uh because\
payment history is per is % of your\
overall score so majority of your score\
comes from ontime payments the longer\
you have this loan the more ontime\
payments get reported the better that um\
it will improve your credit score so it\
really has really great effects as long\
as you're doing it for a lengthy amount\
of time a shorter amount of time it will\
help initially and then once it's gone\
you're going to not have any more you\
know ontime payments that are reporting\
so then it may lose some of that um some\
of that help because your score May take\
another another hit once it's paid off\
but initially it does help I recommend\
doing longer periods of time it doesn't\
have a hard inquiry that's another great\
benefit so I believe my internal score\
was around like somewhere around\
there out of\
in my first six months then I got a\
pledge loan I also did get a secure\
credit card too but I got the pledge\
loan I did a $pledge loan for \
months and when I finished doing that my\
internal score was about out of\
um and when that happened when I\
paid the pledge loan off maybe this was\
I don't know if it was the same thing\
but when I paid off my pledge loan\
that's when my secure card actually\
graduated I only did a $deposit I\
got that back and then my secure card\
graduated to\
$um and then I was able to keep\
raising that up so that's just something\
that I want to uh recommend that you\
guys do I'm not sure if it was a\
combination of both but I will say that\
it brought my internal score up very\
high from that to that \
um and the way that it was told to me is\
that when you do a pledge loan\
apparently from what the guy in Navy\
Federal told me they earn a small amount\
of Interest now if you go on to the\
website you'll actually see this um they\
earn % of interest on the pledge loans\
and then they earn % of the interest if\
it's longer than months so you are\
while you're increasing your credit\
score you're also boosting your internal\
credit score that's the benefit for you\
the benefit for Navy Federal is that\
they're they're earning interest off of\
this they really like to see that you're\
using their products and services when\
you leave money in their bank it's in\
you know in their credit union it's\
helping them when you do this it's\
helping them so really what you're\
seeing is there's a mutual beneficial\
relationship going on between us the\
members and the credit union because\
when we get all these products and\
services it does help make them a small\
amount of money and yes it seems like\
it's a very small amount on the\
individual level but if we look at the\
macro level you know when you're doing\
this for a couple of million people it\
adds up to a large amount so just know\
that your small contribution is helping\
in the bigger picture and that does help\
increase your internal score overall all\
right so let's move on to the next one\
EasyStart Certificates\
now this is one that I rarely hear\
anyone talk about with Navy Federal but\
I feel like it's very easy one if you\
guys want I can cover an entire video on\
this particular thing I have not done\
that yet but it's an easy Start\
certificate so investing in the easy\
start certificates with an amount\
ranging from $to $you can do\
that for to months this can\
significantly enhance your relationship\
with Navy Federal so these certificates\
offer uh apy benefits so you can earn a\
little bit on there and it's\
demonstrating a solid Financial\
commitment and in aing your credit score\
at the same time so the minimum deposit\
is as low as $you can do as low as \
the terms are available from to \
months you can add money at any time\
there's no maximum purchase and um you\
can open multiple certificates and you\
can renew it up to days after the\
maturity date so these are another\
they're just another tool that you can\
use to help improve your relationship\
some of us\
um are not in the position or are not\
going to do auto loans right now some\
some of us aren't going to look at\
mortgage loans with them right now so\
you can also have those but if you don't\
have a mortgage loan and you don't have\
an auto loan then you could do a pledge\
loan you can also do a certificate all\
these things help in my opinion I don't\
think the amount matters I just think\
that you're using the product is what\
matters with Navy Federal so uh again\
with with my internal score I never did\
one of these but I it makes me wonder\
what if I would have done an easy Start\
certificate and a pledge loan and a\
secure credit card a flagship checking\
account and direct deposit at the\
beginning this won't you could go as low\
as $on this The Pledge loan you can\
literally do a secur c for\
$\
literally um or you could do a I'm sorry\
a pledge loan for $yes you can\
actually take that money get it back\
then you can pay off % get the %\
back then take that money and then do\
the secure card for as low as $so\
you can completely just keep moving this\
money around so for the most part for\
you to have all of these products it may\
only cost you\
like I don't know like less than $to\
do all of\
these I mean it doesn't really cost much\
and then wait what days to kind of\
have those direct deposits build up\
that might increase your internal score\
right there that might get you very\
close to a so again just all things\
that you can keep in mind I haven't\
talked about the easy start certificates\
so if that's something that you would\
want more information on then just let\
me know i' be more than happy to make a\
video on that I have really not seen\
anyone on YouTube talk about this which\
is why I was so excited to actually get\
this information uh from this guy at\
Navy Federal I mean he was really really\
really nice and he just gave me the\
rundown on all the things and just gave\
me every single reason why these actual\
products and services actually make\
money for Navy Federal and why they're\
going to look at you in a really good\
light and why it helps your internal\
score so yeah uh if you appreciate this\
information definitely like And\
subscribe all right let's move on to the\
next one we already know having any of\
Credit Cards\
Navy Federal credit cards including the\
in the in rewards the secure card it\
will greatly improve your internal score\
just based off what I told you right\
every single Bank makes money from\
interchange fees all of them do when you\
swipe that card the more you use it the\
more money that you're making for that\
Traditional Bank that credit union\
whoever that's the reason why they want\
you to use their card okay they make\
money from these interchange fees so\
that's how it will benefit Navy Federal\
now again what I'm realizing is it\
really doesn't matter it seems like the\
limit that you get the size of the all\
you have to do is be actively using this\
product just use it um and hopefully\
you're starting to notice the the trend\
here there's a trend you need to get\
products that make Navy Federal some\
money that's it the more you use this\
the more it helps them and in turn\
they're they're going to help you so\
swipe your card make money the more\
transactions that you make and that you\
pay back it helps it really really\
really will help and again this is why\
I'm saying even if you're working on\
your credit this does not prevent you\
from getting this started you can even\
if I had a credit score when I first\
started I was able to get the in rewards\
card yes it was a hard inquiry I did\
make a deposit of $okay I was able\
to do that again you can take the same\
start a two start a $pledge loan\
I recommend at least doing the $for\
months or longer I recommend doing it\
longer cuz when you pay off % you get\
the funds back I recommend doing that\
getting the N rewards card if that's all\
that you qualify for and then taking the\
rest of the money sitting it in your\
account your Flagship checking you know\
at least to now not have a fee\
every month and now you have that\
balance you have this you have that you\
you can get a certificate all of these\
things are going to greatly improve your\
internal score it does not cost you a\
lot of money to be able to do all of\
this and the benefit that you get the\
payoff is going to be much greater than\
what it cost you to actually do this so\
definitely again it doesn't matter what\
level you start at you start at the end\
re the end rewards cool anyone can do it\
you start at the level of cash rewards\
cool that's fine get yourself in there\
but you want to get all of these\
products and services all right so I\
Other Key Factors\
want to talk about three other tips\
other key factors that I want you to\
consider credit line increases so\
requesting a credit line increase with\
Navy Federal it can instantly improve\
your utilization overall it's a key\
factor in your credit scoring okay you\
want to utilize the Navy Federal app for\
a soft pool when you don't do the Navy\
Federal app and you try to call there\
have been reports that you will get a\
hard pull for a credit line increase so\
you want to utilize that and it will um\
you know minimize the impact of having\
that hit on your credit score so\
definitely go ahead ask for credit line\
increases if you already have a card\
with them just because it can greatly\
increase your credit score if your\
utilization is high and maybe you're not\
in the place to pay off a lot of um debt\
right now increasing the limit can also\
help reduce that ratio okay um optimal\
payment timing now this kind of goes\
without saying of course but paying your\
credit card um on the statement closed\
they\
um not on the due date it can maximize\
your credit score boost all right now\
this is something that just again it\
kind of goes without saying but this\
strategy can elevate your score by \
points um emphasizing the importance of\
having strategic payments and what I\
mean by that is essentially if you pay\
down your utilization like let's say\
down to\
% right at the closing cycle date and\
that reports it's going to look very\
very good it's going to look like you're\
you're paying your card and you're very\
and you're not using much of of the\
limit that can also help the credit line\
increases another way I'm just saying\
some things where you want to consider\
these other factors\
because regardless to having a high\
internal score like let's say you do you\
do all of this and you get a perfect\
internal score if you want to help\
yourself a little bit more improve your\
credit score at least get to like a \
range and if you can try to get rid\
of all the derogatory information all of\
this will greatly greatly greatly help\
you so\
um and then of course maintaining a high\
credit score that that leads us right to\
that so focus on optimizing payment\
history your your uh utilization your\
credit age mix and new credit these\
components significantly influence your\
credit score with on Time payments and\
utilization being the most impactful so\
they contribute to % of your score\
respectively and of course if you've\
been on this channel for a while I've\
already talked about this a whole lot so\
I know you're already aware of this but\
if you're new and you haven't been here\
then I want you to know that maintaining\
a high credit score is very important\
now with Navy Federal in this particular\
topic yes having a high internal score\
is really really good having a high\
internal score does not make up for\
having poor credit or having a majority\
of like derogatory mark s now what I'm\
saying is even with bad credit it does\
not stop you from getting these higher\
limits or getting things with Navy\
Federal but if you have a credit report\
with a bunch of derogatory marks and you\
owe like collections charge offs\
that you got to clean that up you you\
you just have to cuz having bad credit\
is or low credit is one thing having a\
credit report where you have a bunch of\
accounts that you didn't pay on is\
something totally different okay you got\
to understand those things are not the\
the same thing having a bunch of\
derogatory marks and having a low credit\
score is not the same exact thing\
because I you can have a credit\
score and get denied from having one\
collection or one charge off because\
they're going to say you have too many\
accounts that you haven't paid back even\
with the credit score I've had one\
and denied not by Navy Federal but other\
places by having that now with Navy\
Federal I've had two charge offs and\
still have my credit card graduate to\
get a $limit so again I'm not\
saying that with navy fedal I'm just\
saying in general you want to take care\
of that because you can't I mean you're\
not going to just go to Navy Federal you\
want to go to other places in maximize\
right so you want to have a high\
internal score but just know that if you\
want to get the full effect of the\
benefits you do need to make sure that\
your credit score is in good shape or\
has the best shape that you can get it\
in so I'm not saying it has to be\
perfect I'm just saying that you you\
need to get it in the best shape that\
you possibly can in order to help\
yourself you just want to put yourself\
in the best position possible to be able\
to win that's all I'm saying put\
yourself in the best light that you\
possibly can in the eyes of these\
institutions and you know just really\
try to make sure that you're maintaining\
all these things at the same time as\
doing these other options to increase\
your internal score those are all the\
Thank You\
things that were mentioned to me I wrote\
down as many of them as possible and\
then just added some additional benefits\
that that I heard and then added some of\
those details about you know why does\
this help because I think it's not just\
important to understand you know what\
you should do it's better to understand\
how it works so now you have an\
understanding of why this benefits the\
the institution the uh Credit Union even\
the the Traditional Bank why they want\
you to do these things and how it could\
help you cuz the same way they have an\
internal score I believe that every bank\
has some sort of internal scoring model\
that that they use in order to to grade\
you CU you see people get denied all the\
time even with a credit score\
they get denied it's happened to uh me\
and I can tell you plenty I've had it to\
where they told me because I don't have\
I don't have a bank account I don't have\
a relationship I didn't these things\
actually do matter so you know you could\
take this same internal scoring video\
with Navy Federal and you can apply a\
lot of these same things to another\
Traditional Bank you know this is all\
really good privy um informatio\
They Thought It Was Hopeless\'97Then Their Credit Scores Changed Everything\
now when it comes to credit restoration\
we've cracked the code now very few\
people can actually show you results\

was just a matter of weeks ago on May\
th they had a credit score as a\
matter of fact on May th they had a\

later from a to a so from the\
low s into the credit score range\

FICO score increase now here we go with\
another client i want to show y'all this\
so they actually got\
point FICO score increase let's zoom\
in a little bit so y'all can see\
points y'all see that right here\

Experian FICO\
points so I just showed y'all we had a\
client that credit score went up\
points now I'm showing you this one\
right here where they went up points\
and this is all recent so this is not a\
fluke completely different client both\
on Experian now when we look at their\

States when it comes to results we get\
the best results in the industry hands\
down call the number on the screen get\
started today cp Restoration\
i just want to say good morning to you\
all this is my personal testimony about\
CP Credit Restoration man it's been\
years I've been trying to get my credit\
situation sorted out and boom I got\
turned on to CP and I want to say it's a\
thumbs up times my credit situation\
was in the low fives and I work with CP\
Restoration and in no time I'm talking\
split of a second I got my perfect\
results within a week i'm now in the\
s CP credit restoration and I thank\
you very very much i'm out all right so\
the same client you just saw provide a\
testimony as y'all can see I just want\
to illustrate this you see on March st\
dispute results became ready we saw a\
point credit score increase and this\
is FICO score for a lot of y'all who say\
you showing Credit Karma we're logged\
into Experian which shows the FICO aid\
and their credit rating changed from\
poor to good their credit score\
increased\
points that is substantial that\
means that their credit score was in the\
credit score range so they were\
around like a \
if my math is correct and as y'all can\
see this was not that long ago this was\
on March st as of the shooting of\
this video that was less than weeks\
ago so as y'all see up here date\
generated March st now as y'all\
can see Wells Fargo bank card deleted\
off the credit report portfolio Recovery\
Associates this is a collection that was\
removed off the credit report we have\
Synchrony Bank American Eagle credit\
card removed off the credit report\
another collection removed off the\
credit report yet another collection\
removed off the credit report now as you\
can see this isn't the same account\
these are different collections so you\
see the before and the after all right\
so as y'all see this was deleted off the\
credit report and again this is just a\
small collection no big deal but as you\
can see on the credit report it shows\
collection doesn't matter if it's only\
$\
the fact that this is showing as a\
collection is going to drag your credit\
score so you want to make sure that\
these items are completely wiped off the\
credit report here's another example\
this again this one $\
when you look at this this is reporting\
a collection for close to years right\
since all the way up until March of\
when we were able to get this\
account deleted off the credit report\
all right you have an American Eagle\
Synchrony Bank so again small balance\
this was a charge off this was opened in\
this actually went negative in \
all right so th this account was\
actually almost close to being phased\
off normally right cuz accounts will\
stay on your report for years you have\
almost about to come off the\
credit report but we got it off right\
cuz this is a long time when you think\
about this this is a long this is a lot\
of years of having derogatory items off\
your credit report and as this client\
suggested they couldn't find a solution\
and they've tried other companies to try\
to get this collection off of their\
credit report for years as you can see\
this has been dragging them down for so\
long and I'm so happy to say that we\
were actually able to help them get this\
account removed as y'all can see the\
item was deleted off the credit report\
for months and months and in fact for\
years they had a credit score in the low\
s all the way into and as I\
stated earlier in the video on March\
rd which was only a couple weeks\
ago on March th that's the last day\
that they had poor credit boom on April\
nd which was only less than a week ago\
about a week ago a now look at that\
for so long they had poor credit this\
stretches back years right ever since\
they had a poor credit score but\
now they have a good FICO credit score\
right and this is the highest this\
client has ever got their credit score\
and this is after working with CP\
Restoration now it doesn't matter if\
it's student loans collections\
bankruptcies child support repossessions\
or any type of derogatory account\
inquiries we can get it removed off your\
credit report whether it's a negative\
account or maybe you have a positive\
account that has high utilization we can\
get anything removed off your credit\
report so if you're interested and you\
want to start having good credit and get\
funded from the banks I've dropped a\
link in the description of the video to\
get set up with CP Restoration the\
number one credit restoration company in\
the United States hands down no\
competition we get the best results and\
we get the job done quickly so if\
anyone's interested I've dropped a link\
in the description of the video you can\
also call our number to speak with a\
representative that's all for today's\
video until next time take it easy and\
we'll talk to you soon peace i know\
we've done a lot of these like virtually\
but this is the first sort of inerson\
one so I definitely wanted to jump right\
in as far as just the overall state of\
credit restoration but before we get\
into that I want to just dig a little\
bit into your experience in the credit\
space for those who don't know who you\
are and you know how you're able to get\
such great results and how you've been\
able to build up the number one credit\
restoration business in the United\
States for the best results hands down\
where did this wealth and knowledge come\
from i've been doing this for about \
years\
and it happened i worked for a company\
called Choice Point and I was trying to\
get a job there and they had three\
different criteria one of them was\
background check credit check and the\
drug test and I failed two criteria and\
one was the credit check and lo and\
behold it was the secrets of fixing\
credit when they sent me the HR and they\
said "Hey you've got to you got to go\
back and dispute the items." And they\
were a sister company of Acroofax listen\
to what they gave in that pamphlet and I\
looked up like my gosh this is really\
everything I need to make this thing\
happen and it was a game changer fast\
forward to today it changed tremendously\
come back back in the days when I did\
credit it just was something verbal now\
it's AI it's it's different technology\
so it's it's a different it's a\
different game piece of I know we've\
been working for probably the past \
years or so and even in that time period\
I've learned a lot from you\
saw some of the differences and when I\
was really looking into credit\
restoration right so one of the things\
that I try to do I went to the internet\
and I saw all the information that's out\
there and there was a lot about these\
templates section and all that and I\
literally tried everything right i was\
on this journey of wanting to fix my own\
credit and nothing happened right and I\
was you and I were talking about this\
earlier how and I've shared this with\
the audience how I went through this\
whole journey of trying to figure out\
how do I get more access to credit\
because I saw how credit basically was a\
main contributor to the quality of life\
playing whether getting an apartment man\
getting jobs i worked in federal\
government contracting part of the\
security class they pull your credit\
report and you have to explain every\
late payment collection money that you\
go you have to explain that so I saw how\
credit was like the main factor when it\
comes to quality of life as far as\
getting jobs getting housing or even\
transportation that's why I wanted to\
fix my credit cuz like a lot of other\
people out there they have these\
mistakes that have lingering effects\
absolutely so I went through this\
journey trying to fix my credit because\
of course my biggest dilemma and we've\
shared this how I student loans that\
even after I paid them off they had late\
payments on it so I work with a handful\
of different credit restoration\
companies i was going about the whole\
DIY process and at the time what was\
popular online was dispute templates so\
talk about dispute templates how has\
that changed over time even in the last\
couple of years working with you because\
I know it doesn't always work the same\
there's artificial intelligence now what\
are some of the important considerations\
as far as the process of credit\
restoration now versus in times past\
sure absolutely it's a quick question so\
these days it's really important for you\
to dispute the item on the customer's\
behalf as always the customer that's\
very important the bureau want to know\
that it's the actual individual\
disputing the actual items under a court\
not a credit repair agency because if\
they see that what happened that they\
turned into a third party letter that\
you get it turned into frivolous\
information frivolous dispute it's\
really important to do your best to\
create the dispute as if it's a actual\
customer disputing item the credit\
reporting agencies don't want it to\
appear as though it's a third party and\
the thing is it's so funny i see online\
like a lot of people it'll show like\
stacks of letters hundreds of letters\
they're going into the mail to send that\
out i know years ago we talked about how\
once you started to scale that became\
somewhat of an issue because you're\
sending all the same letters through our\
thing post office the templates don't\
work the templates no longer work even\
logging on to Equifax experience\
changing and clicking not mine never\
late things like that that stuff doesn't\
work it's become very meticulous they\
know what's going on they know that\
credit repair agencies exist but they're\
doing a really good job of bouncing\
these things back so that's what puts us\
in the camp cuz we really know i would\
say these days the game changes every\
two or months on how to do disputes it\
really does and we what's really\
successful our claim the fate is we keep\
the our ear to real we have a secret\
sauce we have hired a team called\
bureaucrat\
and we have amazing results because we\
just do this day in and day out let's\
elaborate on that because I know\
sometimes people might send in disputes\
and they're wondering like what's going\
on how come they haven't seen any\
traction with it so even though the\
credit reporting agency may have\
received the dispute or they received\
the paperwork there's just no moving on\
it so talk about how there's the\
difference with the bureau callers and\
fall and how able to resolve that\
absolutely so yeah when we send out the\
document to these guys the bureaus get\
so many disputes and so what we do is we\
fortify that by calling the credit\
bureau and say "Hey my name is Mike\
Jackson finding the actual consumer and\
I'm I sent out this document i want to\
confirm that these items have been sent\
out did you receive it?" And so even\
moving forward to even having the right\
terminology to get those items out with\
the disputes that have been set so it's\
just really actually communicating with\
having a conversation with them to\
actually pull up those documents and\
speak to those things one one of the one\
of the most important things besides the\
accounts that are on the file is the\
public record information that's really\
number one because those things are\
connected to the call credit vendor so\
those are things connected to the\
accounts and increase that you want to\
dispute so we have to make sure those\
things are renewal first before anything\
else and after that % of the job is\
done\
yeah that's a good point cuz I always\
thought like for example when you get\
these templates and you and it says this\
account does not belong to me it's not\
mine and it comes back verified because\
the information that's on the header is\
also the information that's on your\
credit report such as your address so if\
you're disputing a C and it's not mine\
but credit headers have your name and\
address and that's also on your credit\
report and it's on the accounts that\
you're disputing and okay there's\
multiple identifying marks that connect\
that account to you that that's a really\
important thing i also wanted to talk\
about because one of the things we get\
right is why is credit restoration so\
expensive at least with our service and\
as far like what you were just talking\
about the bureau caller if anyone's ever\
actually called in and waited to get\
connected with a vibe representative\
because of the volume of disputes coming\
in people calling it's usually all wait\
right so you're disputing a particular\
item you have Equifax transient and\
experian so if the average weight time\
is what minutes minutes minutes\
sometimes an hour two hours late for one\
client and one plan per bureau so you're\
doing the same thing for Equifax\
exterior transient so they're waiting on\
the phone all day long just to dispute\
your file and we have probably from to\
customers at any given time we\
probably have hundreds of people that\
sign up because our business is a\
referral based business so once you\
start seeing results you're introduced\
me to your mom your wife your kid your\
cousin and so on and so forth so we get\
a lot of traffic but it's very\
meticulous first of all we have to\
create the document to make sure that\
the the documentation is accurate the\
names are accurately and now with the\
bureaus I mean as of this year they\
started implementing ports with\
TransUnion and Equifax and there's new\
SMS technology that requires you to have\
access to SMS codes and things like that\
to get into the file that makes it\
difficult for other credit repair\
agencies to do the job so we have to\
work on that over working on that\
getting SMS text code forms but the\
calls are very sophisticated in that\
they're very specific in how you do the\
disputes for them to be affected\
communicating with you the client we\
have the customer service team we have\
like a shi bureau calls we have\
individual that call on behalf of female\
customers and male customers and we have\
ruply meetings to discuss all the new\
internal challenges workarounds and\
solutions to being the best in the\
nation but it is a very meticulous\
sophicic the key process to do the job\
but as you see at Pride Plug we we come\
out with nothing but results absolutely\
week in week out we've been showing this\
for years now now another thing I wanted\
to ask you about as far as your opinion\
now we hear a lot about AI artificial\
intelligence right there's a ton of apps\
out now that you know are basically\
they're able to read in the credit\
report identify the derogatory marks and\
then create these unique AI scripted\
dispute letters given AI do you think\
credit restoration is getting easier as\
far as getting results or is it getting\
more difficult or do you think AI is\
going to be a gamecher as far as the\
consumer and being able to dispute items\
on the credit report or do you think the\
credit report and going to constantly\
come up ways of making it more\
challenging what do you think the role\
AI is in credit restoration ai is great\
for creating efficiency on the credit\
bureau side you're able to use the\
technology to read the documents and\
move a lot more efficiency efficiency\
than to validate disputes and to deem\
them frivolous on RSI it's good to make\
each document look as though they are\
from the actual individual and not make\
duplicates cuz templates don't work\
anymore but on the human connection is a\
critical part speaking to an actual\
representative waiting for them that's\
really the secret sauce of is speaking\
to them knowing what to say to get the\
item to be removed from the file what I\
see a lot in the comment section right\
there might be someone who signed up\
later but got resolved quicker talk\
about let's say a disputes that are\
deemed frivolous or maybe there's a file\
that has a lot of derogatory sometimes\
you can't dispute everything all at once\
talk about sort of the strategy or the\
logic behind disputing in batches versus\
just disputing everything and how that\
affects the results because what I see\
sometimes someone who might have a\
really dirty file let's say \
derogatory items versus someone who\
might have five derogatory items and\
they're seeing other people get results\
quicker even though they may have\
started earlier and they might be\
skeptical or a little hesitant talk\
about that first why disputes are being\
frivolous and they be classified as that\
and in addition to that why you can't\
dispute all items all in one good\
question so when we do disputes it has\
to make sense we're trying to paint a\
picture and tell a story first thing we\
do is look at the public record\
information some customers may have \
addresses that has to go first\
that are connected to accounts name\
variations phone numbers that all of\
that has to be removed first before we\
even start disputing accounts because\
they're all connected so I I would\
dispute no more than five to seven items\
at a time because what part of the story\
that you're telling to the credit\
bureaus saying that these items are not\
yours so naturally the chance of all the\
items not being yours is live in a city\
so it's got to make sense and then you\
just go with the flow of what the\
bureaus are doing depending on how the\
disputes are coming off that's how we\
make our decision on the next go around\
of disputes\
so do you think is there a certain\
threshold you feel like where okay if\
it's x amount of talents you can dispute\
them all at once or if you go beyond a\
certain number of derogatory accounts\
you need to dispute then maybe batch\
them or do them in a different moment\
time yeah I would definitely batch them\
and do it different moments in time\
because it's just they like I said it's\
just you don't want to seem suspicious\
on your disputes it's kind of makes\
sense cuz the reality is these items\
that are on your file are more than\
likely yours these are things that\
you've created over time you bought them\
and so you know what you're really\
having in reality is a second chance so\
we don't want to take that for granted\
right we don't want to just say "Okay we\
can just delete these items and not pay\
these bills pay these account."\
definitely want to take it take take\
accountability and use it as a second\
chance for The other thing I wanted to\
highlight sometimes it seems like credit\
repair credit restoration is like a\
revolving door we might come across the\
same client maybe every months every\
other year even though they're able to\
get things off their credit report\
they're able to get that fresh start\
fresh start building relationship with\
banks but it seems like nothing's\
changed you're in that predicament again\
and obviously it gets harder to dispute\
things once you gone through that all\
over again multiple times what's your\
message to that revolving door type of\
credit client right you is always\
needing credit restoration multiple\
times what's your message to them to get\
out of that rib yeah first of all\
funding it now becomes a thing that\
pretty much all social media speaks\
about even find any child about money i\
would focus so much on the funding as\
much as I'd focus on what to do with the\
money there's all different options to\
get into real estate get investing you\
can get into franchising you need to get\
into tour right but come up with a\
bonafide strategy first because you got\
to pay the keys back you don't want to\
get into it with the mindset of going to\
burn the bank cuz in reality there's\
only so many banks right and now these\
banks are merging there's a dish\
database bases being created to see your\
habits think that you've been doing so\
to to determine whether or not they\
should continue doing business with you\
so it's only a bill so far before you\
hit a wall so yeah you can come back to\
listen to the continue cleaning your\
credit but then you'll only have so many\
options to get money the last coin I\
would like to talk about right now and\
this is something that a lot of clients\
find themselves in where we're able to\
get things removed off their credit\
report but because there's so many\
accounts that are removed and they're\
left with that then file and are\
somewhat disappointed about their\
funding prospects are unrealistic as far\
as what they can do as far as acquiring\
funding after they no longer have\
derogatory accounts on their pore what\
advice do you have to customers like\
that and then the other thing is there's\
situations where remove account that\
have like high utilization right even it\
might be in good standing but it's on\
the verge of going into default right\
and it's a preemptive thing to get it\
removed so it's not affecting your DTI\
what should people do in that situation\
where okay they had these accounts for\
several years in good standing they're\
on the verge of default once it's\
removed they're going to have to start\
all over from scratch what should people\
do in in that scenario should they\
figure out a way to pay down the debt so\
that they keep the history so that once\
the other accounts are removed they can\
still qualify for funding could they\
have primary score should they just get\
the account removed they start from\
scratch what's your guidance so once you\
do several things i.e make any late\
payments go over the limits uses all\
your relationship with the bank\
internally right so you could pretty\
much call it quits when you asking for\
prenum increases or any types of\
concessions it'll be difficult for you\
to get it so I would delete the account\
in the case where a customer has\
multiple negative accounts and he now\
has a BIN file where we can anticipate\
that he's going to add the BIN file my\
suggestion is to start building\
primaries and authorize users but you\
need to do those simultaneously while\
we're viewing those items from your FOB\
so a lot of people I noticed let's say\
for example they have an account a\
credit card account they may have had\
some late payments or late marks on\
their credit report now the account is\
in good standing but it still has the\
late marks and they want to keep the\
account what should what should someone\
do in that situation yeah so you know if\
the account of maybe to years from\
the date that the person made the late\
payment then\
there's a certain forgiveness period so\
it won't count to get them as much as it\
would if it's less than years if it's\
less than years we more and they need\
funding right away to leave the account\
but if it's older than that then you\
know they'll be good to go so you think\
someone should keep an account with a\
late payment if let's say the late\
payment was from four years ago correct\
disputing the late payment verse\
removing the account entirely what are\
the scenarios for each of those and as\
far as the CP restoration\
what as far as like removing late is\
that something that is feasible or\
something that you would recommend yeah\
we've tried to remove late payments in\
the past we've been unsuccessful it's a\
hit or miss so it's easier for us just\
to rehook the entire town and shared\
leave like I showed earlier the the\
relationship is dissolved with the\
credit with the agency once there you\
have leave payments I would just I would\
remove the account if it's a if it's an\
account that's newer and replace it with\
a primary or authorize you to trade by\
and as far as like removing versus\
disputing late payment like if someone's\
just adding it like they want to keep\
the account I know you mentioned that's\
not the strategy as far as like it's\
harder to get the late payment with\
versus get the account of is there a\
difference in the process\
yeah there's definitely a difference in\
the process we would have to dispute the\
item with the actual creditor if it's a\
leaned as far as removing the account\
itself is directly with the bureau\
that's the different Excellent so\
basically you're trying to get so\
essentially the creditor of the data\
furniture has the ultimate call as far\
as how the payment is reported whether\
it's laid or payment is agreed and\
that's something that I guess as a\
consumer you have less of impact as far\
as determining how that's going to play\
out\
ucc-the secret law that lets you fight back against debt collectors\
what if I told you that many of your\
debts are backed by hidden security\
interests and you have the legal right\
to challenge them using UC\
now in this video I'm going to show you\
how the UCC article gives you the\
power to question who really holds the\
lean on your life and how to use filings\
notices and challenges to expose the\
truth i've studied the UCC i've studied\
secure transactions and private remedy\
strategies and I'm here to help you take\
back control of your contracts and your\
credit now before we dive into this\
video remember to hit the like button\
remember to hit the subscribe button if\
you hit the like button and the\
subscribe button you'll be able to fully\
tap in on a consistent basis because I\
do post Monday through Friday so you\
want to make sure to do that so you do\
not miss a beat number two the reason\
why I want you to shoot that like button\
is so that we can be at the top of the\
algorithm and people can see this type\
of information now when you do that that\
just pushes me to create more content\
all the love that y'all been giving on\
the last few videos is the reason why\
I'm still making videos to this day okay\
and one more thing man this is not legal\
advice this is not financial advice make\
sure to do your due diligence all my\
rights are reserved okay i do not take\
any liability for you employing these\
strategies if you don't fully understand\
it and you don't get results okay do\
your due diligence make sure to fully\
understand it before you take action you\
dig what I'm saying now what we're going\
to be talking about we're going to be\
talking about article UCC we're going\
to talk about how this applies to you\
we're going to talk about how to\
challenge a security interest the power\
of a UCCCfiling and we're going to\
talk about the different strategic moves\
and red flags to look out for when using\
Article okay so make sure you stay all\
the way to the end so that you can get\
all of this information that I'm about\
to give you now let's dive straight in\
first things first uh I want to talk\
about the article you dig what I'm\
saying if you come to UC article okay\
this is particularly for um secured\
transactions okay it governs those\
secure transactions so when we're\
talking about any any type of loan that\
is connected to a auto loan mortgage\
right anytime real or personal property\
is used as collateral okay this\
regulates security agreements financing\
statements leans and the priority of\
claims and also anytime a loan is\
secured that's when the UCCCis applied\
so if you get a secure loan right if you\
get secured auto loan anything that is\
connected to real property or whatever\
the case may be this is when UCCC\
essentially applies now when someone\
claims the security interest in your\
property even your name the UCCCis the\
playbook so you want to get very\
comfortable with the UCCCokay first\
section is going to talk about the\
general concepts um definitions the\
second section is going to talk about\
the applicability of the article nine\
the second section is going to talk\
about effectiveness of security\
agreements attachments of security\
interests rights of parties to security\
agreements it's going to break down the\
understanding of security agreements and\
security interests who has it when it\
applies\
um it's also going to have the law\
governing perfection and priority which\
is super important when you think of\
perfection and priority you think about\
it on the aspect of uh uh uh uh for\
perfection perfection refers to the\
process of completing all necessary\
steps to make a security interest fully\
enforceable against third parties and\
then priority on the other hand\
determines in the order in which\
multiple creditors with security\
interest in the same collateral will be\
paid on a debt or its default okay so\
when you look at um article it's going\
to break down um you know even even the\
perfection and priority of things okay\
who's who actually should have security\
interest who gets paid out if it is done\
correctly okay dives even deeper right\
to the bank right to the third party\
filing any information on filing right\
in event of a default and enforcement of\
security interest right so you're going\
to get a lot of valuable information\
just specifically talking about secured\
transactions\
and I bring this up so that and I show\
you the whole subsection because when\
we're talking about security interest\
when we're talking about securities when\
we're talking about uh secured\
transactions I think that the UCCCis\
the birthplace for understanding how to\
navigate and maneuver it now that's only\
one piece of the puzzle okay but the\
reason why I'm going over it today is\
because I think that it's a strong piece\
of the puzzle especially when it comes\
to um you know transactions that have\
collateral attached to it all right so I\
want to talk about when this is going to\
apply to you okay most debts such as\
auto loans mortgages or even some credit\
cards are secured without full\
disclosure now under article full\
disclosure is required okay number two\
you may have unknowingly signed away\
rights via a security agreement so they\
give you what's called a security\
agreement a security agreement is a\
legal contract that grants a lender a\
security interest in a borrower's asset\
collateral to secure repayment of a loan\
or other obligations in essence it\
protects the lender by allowing them to\
seize and potentially sell the\
collateral if the borrower defaults on a\
loan okay now I want to particularly\
talk about the security agreement and\
when it becomes void okay a security\
agreement becomes void or ineffective in\
certain circumstances mainly under the\
uniform commercial code in the US so\
when we dive into\
um the different things that determine\
whether a security you know one has\
security interest on a particular\
property or particular collateral so\
here are the things that essentially\
will determine whether or not uh uh uh\
uh one or bank has true security\
interest because this security interest\
or that word in particular is the reason\
why they're able to do things like take\
your loan i mean they're able to do\
things like repossess your vehicle or\
take your property or foreclose or\
whatever the case may be but when you\
come from the aspect of understanding\
what gives one security interest you can\
start to use that against them so the\
first things first that it talks about\
is satisfaction of an obligation a\
security agreement remains in effect\
until the secured debt or other\
obligation is satisfied at this point\
the security interest typically expires\
so when we go to the aspect of the\
obligation being satisfied what if what\
if the obligation is satisfied from the\
very beginning they sold it to Wall\
Street and they immediately lost\
security interest that's one number two\
when a debtor fulfills all obligations\
secured by collateral and pays the\
associated expenses fees and they may be\
able to still redeem the collateral the\
secure party is required un to file a\
UCCC termination statement and send one\
to the depth door within days after\
receiving a authenticated demand from\
the depth door when the debt is\
satisfied and no commitment to advanced\
value exists i think that's interesting\
okay the secure party must file a UCCC\
termination statement or send one to the\
depth door within days after\
receiving an authenticated demand from\
the depth door that's interesting okay\
number two if there's mistakes that you\
could lose your security interest by uh\
mistakes in the depth door's name in a\
security agreement can invalidate it or\
an inadequate description of the\
collateral in the security agreement can\
also render it valid number three\
deptor's lack of rights in collateral a\
security interest attaches to collateral\
and becomes enforceable against the\
debtor only when certain conditions are\
met including when value has been given\
which is super important because\
according to contract law one of the\
things that we should uh understand is\
that there should be true lawful\
consideration meaning that there should\
be a true value exchange if there's no\
value exchanged then they're then\
whoever is saying that you're obligated\
to owe them they really lack standing\
okay so um the depthor has rights and\
collateral or the power to transfer them\
okay if value has been given but if\
you're the one that's given value then\
you're the one that kind of has the true\
control it also says that if a security\
interest never attaches to collateral\
and if there's no written security\
agreement or the secure party doesn't\
possess the collateral the creditor is\
unsecured if there's any type of fraud\
or misrepresentation I think that's\
self-explanatory\
if a security agreement is entered based\
on fraud or misrepresentation by one\
party it can be considered void and\
lacks legal enforcability termination\
events as defined in this agreement okay\
the agreement has termination events in\
there you can go check that sale of\
collateral in some cases a purchaser or\
transfer of collateral may take\
possession of it free of security\
interest in the case the secure party\
only right would be in the proceeds from\
the sale so even when you're looking at\
them repossessing your vehicle then\
selling your vehicle you're the only\
secure party because you're the one that\
has you're the only one that brought\
value to that very agreement to start\
off with and then we talk about an\
aspect of a recision security interest\
given rise to the right recision becomes\
void when the consumer exercises that\
right it's very interesting it says that\
your security interest you lose security\
interest when the consumer exercises\
their right of recision the security\
interest is automatically negated\
regardless of whether it was recorded or\
perfected so when you do the right and\
recision they can't just repossess your\
vehicle just because you did it okay it\
even dives deeper i suggest you look\
this up gather as much information as\
you can but here's the thing okay this\
can apply to you because obviously you\
may have unknowingly signed away your\
rights using the security agreement that\
can easily be challenged based off of\
those factors I just mentioned so make\
sure that you are willing to challenge\
them on these things make sure you're\
willing to ask them the right questions\
then we dive into entities that may file\
a UCCClane against you or your trust\
okay and obviously it just wouldn't make\
sense you just file a UCCc\
which is more of an amended defiling and\
essentially put yourself in a position\
to where uh now you are the one in\
control of or have ownership over\
whatever it is that they say that they\
now own you have to have security\
interest now if there's a lean there\
must be a contract and you have a right\
to demand proof of that contract being\
bought no uh being perfected right uh uh\
uh you have a right to demand proof\
under UCCC -\
you know uh anything under article you\
have so many rights as it pertains to a\
secured transaction okay now next\
question is how to challenge a security\
interest number one the first thing you\
want to do is you want to request the\
original security agreement a\
authenticated copy now I want to pull\
this up too Okay so I want to pull up\
what a authenticated copy of something\
is okay just for the record and\
particularly talking about a security\
agreement now this is important because\
when I'm asking for a copy I'm not\
asking for a photo copy i'm not just\
asking for a copy i'm asking for one\
that has been authenticated to be true\
and real okay so an authenticated copy\
of a sec of a security agreement is a\
duplicate of the original security that\
has been certified as genuine and valid\
okay in simpler terms the security\
agreement is a contract between a lender\
and a borrower where the borrower grants\
the lender a security interest in\
certain property to secure a loan or\
other obligation now an authenticated\
copy means that a process has been\
performed to verify that the copy is\
true accurate and is a true and accurate\
duplicate of the original agreement this\
process reduces the risk of fraud and\
ensures the documents's validity dig\
what I'm saying so why is a\
authenticated copy important legal\
recognition it provides proof that a\
valid security agreement exists and can\
be legally recognized in various\
proceedings is often required when\
seeking to enforce the security\
agreement particularly in different\
jurisdiction and protects against fraud\
okay it helps prevent the use of forged\
or altered documents okay it says how is\
a security agreement authenticated under\
the UCCC which the govern which governs\
secure transactions as a security\
agreement is considered authenticated\
when the depth door signed it which can\
include electronic signatures\
authentication can also involve having\
the agreement certified by a notary\
public or another authorized individual\
so it's crucial that you get a certified\
or authenticated copy of whatever it is\
that you're asking for this goes for\
authenticated copy of the original\
promisary note this goes in in in this\
goes handinhand with the security\
agreement when you're looking for\
something to be authenticated just know\
that it was either signed by an\
authorized individual that can certify\
it or a notary\
okay see if we can find any images on it\
okay I'm not really seeing anything in\
particular that will give you Okay we'll\
just move on so you want to get that\
authenticated copy that's super\
important number two you want to demand\
lawful accounting per article -\
under the UCCC um I'll pull it up real\
quick for the record to show that you\
can request for all accounting request\
the list of collateral and statement of\
the account okay\
so you have a right to ask for\
authenticating records\
from a creditor as the depth door okay\
statement of account regarding list of\
collateral so again these are the things\
that you can ask for under article \
which is why it's important when you are\
trying to start when you're starting to\
challenge a secured transaction all the\
loans mortgages etc some credit cards\
then this is exactly where you want to\
come in terms of the playbook okay then\
we dive into filing a UCCCto terminate\
to terminate fraudulent leans or expired\
leans so if you get a lean and it is\
from a party that doesn't that is not a\
secure party you can file a UCCC to\
pretty much get it amended make you the\
secure party then you can also use\
conditional acceptance proving which\
demands proof of valid security interest\
okay so these are the things that you\
can ask for and then when you dive into\
you having a right to challenge someone\
who doesn't have security interest you\
having a right to challenge someone who\
lacks standing right this is where you\
know you are now shifting the burden\
proof on to them for them to prove that\
they have that actual standing which\
they don't another key law to really\
look at is E-which is attachment\
and enforcability of security interest\
proceeds supporting obligations and\
formal requisites which is important\
because it says a security interest is\
only enforceable if there was value\
given we just talked about this the\
depthor has rights in the collateral and\
a valid security agreement exists okay\
so there's there's a couple of factors\
that must be put in place in order for\
one to claim your property or claim they\
have security interest or even enforce\
it right if you're the one that signed\
the agreement and given the full and\
you're the one that has given the full\
value right you're the only one that\
truly has rights in the collateral okay\
you're the ones who truly is the one\
that that that that controls the\
security interest okay and also that\
security agreement if they did the\
security agreement fraudulently or\
misled you to signing away your rights\
as the depth door or as the person that\
gave the value then security interest is\
not enforceable okay so the thing is is\
if there's no agreement there's no\
enforcement under UCCC UCC-\
it is more about consent and proof not\
assumption so if they can prove it prove\
that you have given consent and it's a\
valid uh uh authenticated copy of the\
security agreement and that security\
agreement uh uh uh is not fraudulent in\
any type of way then they can do that\
but we all know that there are some\
fraudulent activities that they do okay\
now I want to talk about the power of\
the UCCCfiling okay because we talked\
about this on this page a while back and\
I kind of want to bring a little bit\
more clarity around the UCCCjust real\
quick just real quick I'm not trying to\
make this whole video about the UCCC\
and if you gotten all the way this far\
go ahead and hit the like button go\
ahead and hit the subscribe button tap\
in with your boy man because we are\
going to stay consistent\
now this is the UCCCif you haven't\
seen it already so you can file your own\
UCCcto claim security and superior\
interest okay you can use it to\
establish your claim over your legal\
name or trust property or whatever the\
secure property is and you can control\
the nar narrative and hierarchy of\
claims okay so essentially they'll file\
the UCCC statements on you but now you\
can actually file it back and say "No\
I'm the secure party." All right so this\
is pretty self-explanatory you fill in\
your information okay and your address\
then you put in put in the depth door\
whether it's your all caps name whatever\
the case may be you can put two depth\
doors if you want and then you put the\
secure party you are the secured party\
okay you'll put the collateral if it's\
your name if it's a trust if it's you\
know what I mean like a car whatever the\
case may be right you check to put if\
it's being held in a trust or if it's\
being administered by a descendants's\
personal rent uh representative\
um it says check only if applicable\
check only one box public finance\
manufacturer home depth door\
transmitting utility right agricultural\
lean nonUCC filing whatever the case may\
be i mean you only check the ones if\
applicable so this technically doesn't\
have to be checked if you fill out this\
information here send it in this is now\
going to uh uh put public notice that\
whatever it is that you put in that\
collateral box is yours and you're the\
secure party behind it when you start to\
do this this actually revokes anybody\
who is claiming that they are that okay\
so that's what the UCCCis for it puts\
you in a different position from being a\
depth door and now you're being looked\
at as the secure party okay now I want\
to talk a little bit about cuz we are\
getting close to the end i want to talk\
about some red flags and some strategic\
moves to make when you are using the\
article and challenging secure\
transactions or even the security\
interest number one you want to watch\
out for those hidden leans and public\
records okay check your public records\
to make sure that there's no no\
judgments or anything on you in\
particular okay number two you want to\
use the Freedom of Information Act or\
the Secretary of State searches to\
uncover the filing so you can actually\
ask the the the creditor directly for\
this information if they don't give it\
to you then they'll be violating the\
Freedom of Information Act if they don't\
give it to you then they'll be violating\
UCCC Article if they don't give it to\
you then they'll be violating the Fair\
Debt Collection Practices Act if they\
don't give it to you they'll be\
violating the Truth Lending Act there's\
so many ways that they're going to\
violate your rights if they don't just\
give you simple information that they\
should and have a duty to give to you\
okay number three learn to spot\
defective security interest and expired\
filings so when you start to ask for\
that authenticated security agreement\
then and they don't give it to you or\
they're not even giving you the proof\
that they have true security interest\
then you have to be willing to to to\
expose them for that okay because if\
there's a lean it has a paper trail and\
you should be able to find it be willing\
to follow it question it and challenge\
it if it is not if they are not\
providing the information they need to\
provide see this game um is really an\
information game okay like if you can\
prove that I owe you or you can prove\
that you are the true holder in due\
course or that you have security\
interest then absolutely I'll adhere to\
whatever it is that you have for me but\
if you can't I don't have to listen to\
you at all and it's this is what\
shifting the burden of proof is okay\
people think that when you discharge\
debt you fill out a couple forms and\
boom it's just going to miraculously\
work but if you have an understanding\
that they are not going to comply given\
the fact that if they comply then\
they'll be revealing some crazy things\
about the matrix they'll be revealing\
that they have been taking advantage of\
you this entire time why would they want\
to do that i don't think they would it\
would take money out of their pockets\
okay so they'll use secure transactions\
to control assets including you but the\
UCCCgives you the tools to question\
challenge and reclaim what's yours\
that's what I want you to use the UCCC\
for get a full understanding of the\
UCCCso you can start to challenge all\
loans so you can start to challenge\
mortgages and not just from a\
perspective of you know the truth to\
lending act and you know uh section \
and you know all the the basic level of\
law that federal law that that you will\
learn out there on top of that get\
comfortable with reading the UCCC and\
read those specific parts that have to\
do with whatever your situation is if\
you're dealing with a secure transaction\
boom you come to article you dig what\
I'm saying article secure transactions\
right\
investment securities article article\
documents of title article six bulk\
transfers and bulk sales article five\
letters of credit article four funds\
transfer article four uh bank deposits\
and collections right article three\
negotiable instrument right article two\
if you got leases article two if it's\
sales article two right a I'm sorry and\
then two and then if you want to just\
learn just overall about the UCCC\
article one like this is s such a great\
learning tool because when you know this\
right here when you have full\
understanding of this right here it\
makes discharging debt it makes\
communicating with debt collectors that\
much easier and that much sweeter so\
make sure you do your due diligence even\

EIN Only NO PG Business Cards That Build Business Credit FAST!\
we're going to discuss some tier \
accounts so you can further utilize\
these to establish your business credit\
profile there are actually four\
different business credit tiers that you\
can use when you're building your\
business credit if you understand how\
these tiers work they can help you find\
the right financing to meet your needs\
while you're building your business\
credit and if you stick around until the\
end of the video I'm going to provide\
you a no PG EIN only business card that\
if approved account holders can\
potentially access up to $in\
business working capital i'm going to\
also provide a referral link that will\
go directly to a sales manager to\
prioritize your application of this\
business card so without further ado\
let's get right into the video let's\
Tier \
begin with the recap of tier accounts\
tier credit is commonly referred to as\
basic trade credit and is the most\
readily accessible type of business\
financing you generally don't need to\
establish business credit history or a\
high personal FICO score for you to get\
approved for these accounts from vendors\
at this level what's more you typically\
don't need to provide a personal\
guarantee that means most tier one\
business credit vendors cannot come\
after your personal assets if your\
company was to default and making basic\
trade credit the least risky form of\
business financing and as a result tier\
credit accounts are a great way to\
build your business credit from scratch\
they can help you establish a handful of\
initial trade lines with each major\
business credit bureau and lay the\
foundation of credit for more essential\
financing in the future conveniently\
tier business credit vendors are often\
supply stores that sell practical items\
for a small business owner trying to get\
off the ground however tier credit\
accounts are often allowances for no\
longer repayment terms than days\
which means they must be repaid within\
that -day time frame and that's also\
the reason why most people refer to\
these accounts as nets as a result\
though you won't incur interest with\
basic trade credit as long as you pay by\
the required due date but you won't be\
able to finance anything for very long\
Tier | Credit Profile\
either next let's discuss the typical\
credit profile needed for a tier \
credit account tier credit accounts\
have the least demanding eligibility\
requirements and you should be able to\
qualify for some of them without any\
previous business credit which is why we\
want to start here you can also qualify\
even if you have bad personal credit\
however you do need to meet the\
following requirements you need to\
operate a business that's in the United\
States have an IRSissue tax ID your\
federal EIN you need to also have a Dun\
and Bradstreet issued Dun's number you\
want to be established for at least \
days you want to have no derogatory\
business reporting or delinquencies and\
applicants must be an authorized officer\
of the organization now with that said\
some of the requirements for basic trade\
credit vary between vendors for example\
a majority of tier one accounts that I\
mentioned in my how to build business\
credit in days video did not require\
you to be established for at least \
days and some may require that you have\
other tier accounts before approving\
you as a result you may need to shop\
around to get your first trade line i\
highly recommend that you refer back to\
that video if you are just beginning to\
establish your business you're going to\
look for the video that shows you how to\
actually structure your business and\
then you can look at the one about\
building business credit with nets and\
then once you're done with both of those\
if you want to come back and watch this\
video this will be the next level so you\
can get those tier accounts we're now\
Tier \
moving on to tier business credit also\
known as advanced trade credit though\
it's still a form of vendor financing it\
gives small business owners access to\
higher lines of credit and longer\
repayment terms than you would get on\
basic trade line accounts if you qualify\
you'll receive a dedicated card attached\
to some of your credit line and the size\
will depend on your business's\
qualifications advanced trade credit\
accounts help you round out your\
business credit report before you\
transition into more traditional\
business financing such as installment\
loans or getting credit cards from a\
financial institution because they're\
harder to qualify for and involve larger\
sums of money they may look better as\
trade lines on your business credit\
report and as a result you should think\
about applying for them as soon as\
you're confident that your chances of\
qualifying are very high the typical\
Tier | Credit Profile\
credit profile needed for tier credit\
accounts will be a little bit different\
than tier tier business credit\
vendors have more restrictive\
qualification requirements than your\
normal tier providers so to get\
advanced trade credit accounts you\
usually need between to five tier \
accounts with positive payment history\
sometimes you may need to have a\
personal guarantee but usually it's\
unlikely you may also need to have \
years of operating history to qualify\
for tier accounts now that we've\
Tier & \
discussed tier and tier and what it\
takes to qualify I also want to discuss\
tier three and tier now the accounts\
that we're looking at today will not be\
tier and tier but it's just good for\
you to actually be aware of what these\
are in contrast with vendor trade lines\
these accounts come from organizations\
that specialize in offering financing\
like banks and credit unions to qualify\
for tier three you should aim to have a\
solid business credit history with a\
dozen or so tier and tier trade\
credit accounts you should also have a\
good business credit score and a track\
record of making timely monthly payments\
while tier three credit accounts are\
significantly more challenging to\
qualify for than the business trade\
lines in the previous tiers they're\
usually well worth the effort they're\
the best way to secure large amounts of\
flexible capital that you can use to\
grow your business for example you can\
get a small business administration and\
SBA loan for up to $million and use\
the proceeds for various purposes\
including acquiring property improving\
real estate or just your own working\
capital i have an entire video that goes\
over SBA loans and I talk about the\
importance of establishing a business\
credit profile and what that means to\
get approved if you would like to watch\
that video I'm going to link that here\
Tier \
tier business funding is very\
different from tiers that we've\
discussed previously it refers to an\
arrangement in which you raise capital\
from an investor such as venture\
capitalist or an angel investor rather\
than a credit arrangement where you\
borrow from a vendor or traditional\
lenders notably these investors usually\
prefer equity financing arrangements\
which require you to give up partial\
ownership of your company so for example\
it might involve selling % of your\
corporation's outstanding shares of\
common stock equity is generally more\
expensive than debt in the long run but\
doesn't come with a fixed monthly\
payment as a result it can be an\
attractive option for businesses that\
have already taken out significant\
amounts of debt and can't afford to\
borrow anymore in addition these\
investors can bring much more than\
capital to the table they're often\
experts of scaling the types of\
companies that they're invested in and\
they offer invaluable guidance they're\
also literally invested in your success\
so it's in their best interest to help\
you as much as possible good business\
credit score certainly won't hurt your\
chances of convincing these investors to\
work with you but it's usually not their\
primary concern they're typically more\
interested in startups that have high\
growth potential and can provide a\
lucrative return now I'm going to share\
three tier accounts with you as well\
as the business card that you can use\
that goes up to $our first tier\
st Account\
account is the -Eleven commercial\
fleet masterard now this is ideal for\
businesses that want to fuel exclusively\
at -Eleven or Speedway Stations with\
this card your business can save up to \
cents per gallon for the first months\
and continue to save cents per gallon\
every time they fill up at participating\
locations there's no setup fee there's\
no annual fee or card fees which makes\
this a very lowcost solution for\
business owners fleet cards are\
generally a great stepping stone some of\
them are more easily accessible in the\
early stages of building your credit\
than others and I was approved for this\
one days ago and it was a $\
credit limit with semionthly repayment\
terms and of course no personal\
guarantee so if you've already\
established five to seven tier one\
accounts and you're looking for the next\
level this is definitely a recommended\
one for you this card should report to\
Experian business as well as done in\
Bradreet according to the representative\
that I spoke with however I don't know\
this for sure things change all the time\
i was just approved days ago and the\
one thing I can confirm is that you can\
get this card with no personal guarantee\
if you want any more details about this\
card there's a link in the description\
where you can apply and if you are\
approved please leave a comment below\
with the approval amount i love to hear\
that from you our second tier account\
nd Account\
is going to be the J C Penney commercial\
account this includes a plastic card for\
you and any authorized users that you\
have to purchase anything in store at J\
C Penney or at JCP.com\
now this card comes with a netterm\
and it is backed by Synchrony Bank this\
card also reports to Experian Business\
and Done in Brad i did apply for this\
card and I was approved for $with\
the netterms again it's no PG there's\
very little information about this\
account so unfortunately I can't give\
any more details however what I can say\
is I wasn't approved right away i did\
have to call when you complete the\
application there's a section that does\
ask you for a personal guarantee you\
unselect that and you can continue\
without it now I did include a link in\
the description to apply let me know if\
you're approved for this one as well our\
rd Account\
third tier account is going to be the\
Lowe's commercial account now if you run\
a business in construction or renovation\
property management landscaping anything\
like that this will be a great option\
for you it gives you % discount on all\
your purchases it also provides a net \
term which can be helpful for managing\

Eliminate Student Loans, IRS & Child Support\
are you currently struggling with IRS debt student loans or child support on your personal credit reports and you\
just don't know what to do because it's weighing heavily on your FICO score Well in this video I'm going to share with you exactly how to get rid of all of\
these things off of your personal credit so that you can drastically increase your FICO score In addition to that you\
can actually permanently remove this debt from your person once and for all So there's three vastly different ways\
of handling this kind of debt And in this video I'm going to share with you exactly how that works So let's get into it\
[Music]\
So let's talk about student loans One in five adults currently right now in the\
United States is in debt with student debt In fact it's over a trillion dollars that people just like you and me\
are holding with student debt just for the mere purpose of trying to get a better education to try to get a better\
job And so that's what's so disheartening about this whole thing is that the system has become a money-making grab with a purpose and\
intent of making money off of you for your student loan in the in interest And\
so they're basically raking people over the coals for the simple mere fact of basically trying to go out there and do\
better for yourself And so what do you do if you're struggling with student debt Well the answer is probably not the\
one that you might want to hear but I have a couple of different options for you to get it permanently p pulled off your personal credit report so that it's\
no longer affecting your FICO score And it's going to be kind of a journey but\
at the same time it's going to be well worth it So for those of you that are struggling with student loans right now that are damaging your personal credit\
you're going to want to listen to everything I have to tell you In fact there is a loophole that you can have some of this debt actually permanently\
removed without having to pay for it at all Now you have to take into account what kind of loan or loans are we\
dealing with here Most of the loans out there to the tune of % are federal loans or federal backed loans Only % of\
student debt is they're private loans So what do you have And you're going to\
have to figure it out Most people like I just mentioned % actually have federal or federal backed loans And so if that's\
the case that's kind of a problem because that stuff sticks around forever In fact in many cases you can't even\
file for bankruptcy against those loans unless of course you have certain circumstances that apply So let's get\
into exactly how to have the stuff removed What's the best course of action to take and what some of the loopholes\
are to actually have the debt permanently removed without actually paying for it So let's talk about the option of getting it under control and\
you know taking the bull by the horns and taking some responsibility for this because as much as we'd like to and complain about how unfair the system\
is the reality is those loans were taken out and you did or maybe you didn't complete your degree I don't know what\
the personal situation is that you have but regardless of whether you finished your degree or not you do have to pay\
that loan back Unless of course you can prove that number one the school that\
you were going to and attending to is permanently closed and you were unable to finish your degree in which case you\
can actually have the entire loan discharge without further paying for it Or if you were misled by the school\
maybe it was a shim shammy type of school um maybe like a Trump University kind of thing if you know what I mean\
and maybe they just weren't legit and they may they were not above board in which case you can actually have the\
entire thing thrown out and not have to pay another dime on that loan Most people though are not going to find\
themselves in those situations And so you need to think in terms of okay well what other situation can I possibly\
qualify for that can get these loans permanently thrown out without me paying another penny toward them Well there's\
other situations and circumstances that you might want to dig into And of course I don't know you personally so I\
wouldn't know whether this applies to you or not But if you are a teacher you could potentially have those loans\
permanently shoved off your personal credit and not have to pay any more money to them Again this this just depends on your personal situation if\
you're a government employee if you work for a nonprofit if you're a nurse doctor or other medical practitioner um if you\
have a disability or if you have and only know those of you that know uh you\
know kind of what whether or not you were part of the income based repayment plan which is the IBR plan if you know\
that you are part of that then there are situations where you can actually have these loans permanently pushed off your\
personal credit reports without paying any more money but only you know whether or not you qualify for any of those\
categories And if you don't well then you're probably going to be on the hook for these loans Now here's the thing A\
lot of people don't understand that there is a way to reset the debt So if you have been struggling and for example\
if these are federally backed loans I'm going to warn you right now that you are going to be in default if it's a\
federally backed loan if you have not paid it for days Okay Sometimes they are a little more lenient depending on\
of course whether or not you actually were participating in the onhold pandemic plan where you basically got a\
pause on your student loans Otherwise it it will actually start to kick in as far\
as a default after days and then of course it will start to report as late\
to the credit bureaus after days Okay that's for the % of you who actually\
have federal loans Okay Now for the % of you that actually have private student loans then you're going to be\
looking at late pays just like any other credit card or loan payment after days In days they'll actually throw\
you into default So you need to figure out where you're at Now here's the good news If you have more than one student\
loan meaning multiple student loans which you can do is actually go to studentaid.gov\
and I will have it down below in the description box Again it's studentaid.gov and you can actually get\
a consolidation loan you can pull all your loans together into one loan and start the process all over again So this\
typically kind of works I don't know if you've ever had the experience many of you have where you go to a car dealership you turn your trade in and\
maybe you still owe money on a lease or on a um you know a financed vehicle And\
so what ends up happening is that the dealership will pay off that loan and then open up a new loan for you for the\
new vehicle So this works the same way where if you have say three loans three student loans and you decide to take on\
a new loan for the consolidation then what'll happen is on your credit reports it'll show that those three loans were\
paid off in full and it'll look good on your credit It'll actually boost your FICO score and then there'll be a new loan that'll open up for the\
consolidation part of this If you can pull that off and if you have the income to do it and if you're not going to be\
bitching and complaining about not wanting to pay your bills and not wanting to pay your you know student loans which I'm hoping that since you\
did benefit from the student loans that you want to pay it back and you want to make good on it then this is the best\
route to take So then once you do this part again you go to studentaid.gov\
you can actually do the whole thing on their website And they're a lot more lenient than you think because some\
people are like "Oh I don't know Monica you know my uh FICO score is you know in the toilet and blah blah blah whatever the case may be And you might be\
thinking well I don't know if I could qualify Well they want you to repay this loan They want to do what they can to\
get you to repay this loan which means that if it means consolidating the loans that you have and starting over from a\
clean slate with a brand new account then they will do that despite what your current financial and FICO score\
situation is So I highly recommend that you do it that way Now once you do the consolidation process then what you want\
to do is start the process of the dispute process with the credit reporting bureaus which is Experian Equifax and TransUnion So if they did\
not update the accounts as paid or showing that they're favorable on your account or your your profile right now\
with Experian Equifax and TransUnion then you're going to want to dispute that because it's now considered inaccurate information Those loans have\
been fully paid through the debt consolidation through studentgov and therefore it should not show as late or\
you know basically anything Now of course it will show that maybe you were days late or days late or days late or whatever the case may be but it\
will show as a closed paid in full account which is going to reflect good on your credit reports even if it's\
showing late Now a lot of times what a lot of things what a lot of times when you do the dispute process a lot of\
people don't realize is that when they do the dispute process sometimes there's a glitch in the system which I love when\
this happens where you actually do a physically mailedin dispute I don't like to do online disputes at all because I\
find that they're ineffective They don't work But if you want to send in a physical letter I have free disputelet\
letters You get them down below Getdisputers.com People try to put the www part in there They don't get to the\
website They freak out So don't put the www part in there Just go to a browser and type in getdisputletters.com\
Without the www part and you'll be able to get my free dispute letters and you basically print them out You mail one\
into Experian one to Equifax one to TransUnion ideally with trackable USPS\
mail It doesn't have to be certified Doesn't have to be priority You don't have to spend the extra money on that Just make sure it's trackable that you\
get a tracking number to make sure you know the date that they receive it And so what ends up happening as you go\
through the dispute process they do an investigation realize that the account has been paid in full And therefore not\
only would the account be updated to reflect positively on your credit but they might also remove all those late as\
well And sometimes that's a glitch in the system and it's a glitch that's worth trying for by doing this dispute\
process So that'll clean that part up Now you'll have a new consolidated one\
lumpsum student loan that you're dealing with and make good on it Make a commitment to make the minimum monthly\
payment because you want the stuff to start reflecting positively on your\
credit and it'll actually start to boost your FICO score and help you in exponential ways if you just play the\
credit game Okay Very very simple very easy to do So okay Well what happens if\
you can't pay Well if you can't pay then you need to start the process of going\
through the list that I talked about before and find out And the list is the complete list is on studentaid.gov on\
who qualifies exactly to have the stuff permanently removed without paying another dime See if you qualify You'd be\
surprised Maybe you do qualify to have the debt thrown out completely without paying any more money And if that's the\
case then go for it You can actually do the full application online at studentaid.gov Down below in the\
description box you'll find that information And I would apply because you never know Listen a lot of people\
don't understand this whole system is so inundated The these staff members in these different organizations especially\
government organizations are up to their eyeballs in work They're they're working tirelessly they're you know they're\
overworked underpaid and a lot of these departments have cut back And so you'd\
be shocked and amazed at how much progress you can make by either asking for a consolidation loan or just simply\
putting in an application to have the whole thing thrown out because they don't really have a lot of time to do\
the full research and rundown on exactly whether or not you qualify And sometimes there's a glitch in that system as well\
where you can literally have something thrown out that maybe you thought was impossible to throw out and you never know until you try So go to that website\
and try to have the damn thing thrown out Now maybe you want to start off with that first if you know that you don't have the ability to repay it and then\
think about debt consolidation options at that same website link if in fact you can't get it thrown out if you don't\
qualify So I would try that first if I were you If I was having you know problems because just based on the low\
income if you're dealing with a low-inccome situation you might actually qualify to have the whole thing thrown out anyway just based on that So that's\
how you do that So after you do your first round of disputes whether or not you actually are able to consolidate or\
if you did the application to have it thrown off um by the way if you also have an identity theft situation I did\
another video on doing a police report if you did have an ID theft situation you might even be able to get your\
student ID or your student loan thrown off just be based on ID theft And so you\
can even potentially furnish your police report either to both studentaid.gov in\
addition to the the U credit reporting bureaus basically stating hey this isn't\
my debt or I had a situation with ID theft here's the here's the report the police report that you want to get from\
the detective after they initially write it up which takes about two to three days after they write up your report\
Then you might even be able to get it thrown off as well because that's another loophole with studentaid.gov\
where you can actually have your debt removed if you can show proof of of ID theft And so you can also try that as\
well In addition to that you could send that into the credit reporting bureaus saying "Hey I had ID theft This needs to\
be removed." and it can be removed off of your credit reports I have a new\
document for you guys at getdisputters.com and you can actually get the letter that\
I recommend that you use for the purposes of asking any creditor\
collection agency etc for verification or validation of debt which is a federal law And so if you ask for verification\
or or validation of the debt which would be the second part so part one would be\
the dispute process only after you've dis you've been able to explore the\
options to whether whether or not you want to consolidate or try to get the throne off all together You can explore\
all of that at studentaid.gov But if you decide well you know I'm going to just go for the dispute process\
because I can't do all of this stuff Well then you go through your dispute process like I said And the second part\
is to actually demand from the creditor which would be the government\
to prove that this is your account This the student loan is your account And you can do this with a brand new letter that\
I have which is now at getdisdutlets.com which you can get down below And you can actually use that letter send it by\
certified mail So listen folks you know you want to be cheap and lazy and you want to try to do this you know some\
other way You're not going to get the results However if you want to do this the way you're supposed to I recommend\
you do an envelope The envelope does not have to be this big by the way It can be a number regulariz business envelope\
But you can clearly see that this is certified which means you have to need to walk into the post office and actually have somebody behind the\
counter you know do this transaction for you This is what a certified card looks like And I always have so many of you\
argue with me Monica you know hardly any of these cards come back Really out of all the years I've been doing this I've\
sent out thousands of these cards I think I only had one that didn't come back So you want them to have a wet\
signature does not matter if it's going to a PO box Nine times out of it will be And somebody will go up to the counter and sign a bunch of these and\
you you'll be one of them And then the postal carrier person or the person behind the counter at the post office rips this off of this envelope and mails\
this back to you And then now you have a wet signature of them receiving your validation of debt letter And basically\
what the letter says which I have a new template at getdisputters.com you can get that put that in this\
envelope and say as per federal law you do have to validate this debt upon my request And the validation needs to be\
some kind of proof of a contract agreement etc And it needs to be signed So it\
can't be just some typed in you know somebody's name or it can't just be here's a statement Believe it or not did\
you know that I can actually I can go on my QuickBooks system right now and I can generate a statement that claims that\
you owe me a million dollars Just because somebody sends you a statement or an invoice in the mail does not mean you owe it Okay But a contract that has\
some kind of signature on it or some kind of agreement that is what you're looking for with the verification of\
debt or validation of debt And so as per federal law and all the case law is cited in that letter you can put that in\
this envelope and they have days from the date that they sign this to get that\
validation of debt to you Okay Now what happens if they don't send you anything Well then you send a copy of this card\
and a copy of the letter that was in this envelope to Experian Equifax and TransUnion and you say "Hey I sent this\
to them on X date." They signed for it on X date It's been more than days and they have not sent me a valid you\
know agreement They have not sent me anything as per federal law That's that that's clearly stated in the letter what\
what they're supposed to send me They didn't send me that Now what if they did send you something What if they sent you I don't know just some statement like I\
said or some kind of invoice that doesn't have your name on there I don't admit to receiving anything Okay because\
technically you did not receive what they are supposed to send you by federal\
law So if they did send you a statement don't confuse the process Don't confuse the minimum wage person who's opening up\
these envelopes and trying to process these different disputes by saying "Yes\
I received something but it was the wrong thing." Because all they're going to see is "Yes I received something."\
Okay They're not going to read the rest of it or care what the hell you have to say beyond "I received something." So\
what you want to say in your letter to the reporting bureaus which is again Experian Equifax and TransUnion you want\
to say "I sent this out They signed it Here's a copy of this card showing that they signed it on this date It's been\
more than days Here's the letter I gave them asking for validation of debt As per federal law they are required to\
give this to me They've given me nothing that validates the debt which would be true because if they send you a\
statement that is not that doesn't count That is not a validation of debt If they\
send you an invoice that is not a validation of debt If they send you some kind of paperwork that has somebody's type name in there that doesn't count\
either So what you want to say is "No I did not receive validation of debt as per federal law." And that's %\
correct That's a truthful statement that you're making because you didn't receive that A statement is not that statement is not a promisary note or agreement or\
a contract That's nothing Right So that's how you want to treat that And\
you know there's a good chance that you might be able to get the student debt off there now does that mean that they can't sue you People ask me this all the\
time They're like Monica well just because I have it removed off my credit report does that mean that they can't you know that that they they can sue me\
now right Well did you know that they could sue you anyway They could sue you anyway regardless of whether it crap\
stays on your credit report So people have this fear that the second stuff falls off their credit report that suddenly they're going to get sued It's\
like well most collection agencies creditors don't waste their time filing lawsuits unless it's more than \
$depending on what they think it's it's worth to be able to go after you And it's almost like trying to\
squeeze you know blood from a turnup It's like why would they put all this legal money into this lawsuit you know\
over a few thousand dollar debt Most of them don't do that Now most student loan loans are on average about $is\
what most people owe with student loans So they might go after you with the lawsuit but just because it's not on your credit report anymore does not mean\
that they won't sue you That's just not how it works folks Anybody can sue you for\
anything Did you know that your neighbor can sue you because they don't like the color of your house Believe it or not\
welcome to the highly litigous society of the United States of America That's what people do So people can sue you for\
anything Just because that's on your credit report doesn't mean that you're you know somehow protected from being sued Just because it's not on your\
credit report doesn't automatically guarantee that they're going to sue you So that's just how it works So that's\
how I would get student loans off I would try to make good on the loans by consolidating by going to studentaid.gov\
and seeing what kind of consolidation programs I could participate in and just restart the process and then just make\
the commitment to make that monthly payment because you did get the education and you know whether or not\
you finished is is not their problem you know you signed for the the debt and it's the best thing to do and it would\
help your credit a lot is if you showed your old debt being paid off in full and now having a new loan that you're going\
to be making good on every single month it's only going to help your credit not hurt your credit So that's what you want to do in the student loan capacity So\
you're like "Okay Monica well that sounds great for student loans but I have IRS debt." So IRS debt is treated\
differently And the good news it's actually easier to deal with IRS debt or other tax obligations even state tax\
obligations depending on the state of course than it is to deal with student loans believe it or not I know that seems outlandish but it's it's true So\
the the strategy that I recommend people to take because most people don't have the capacity to be able to deal with the\
IRS directly on their own and that is to try to find an IRS or tax attorney to\
help you negotiate this Now you might say "Well Monica I can't afford an attorney." Or whatever the case may be\
Well you need to decide am I going to be pennywise pound foolish Because if you owe say I'm just going to pull some\
random number Say you owe $to the IRS But if a tax attorney who can\
get it down to maybe half that or less would charge you would it be worth it\
to pay the tax attorney $to have that debt go from to Well I\
would say yes And in some cases they can get it down even more So you got to stop thinking about the pennywise pound\
foolish mentality because you have to think in terms of what is my long-term goal here and that is to get the IRS\
debt off your back and off your credit And so then that way you can start the process of just having you know a good\
FICO score right So if you feel like well I don't know if I could afford it\
or my tax obligation is not that much so I don't want to be paying you know $$for an attorney to negotiate\
maybe only owe like you know three four $to the IRS So what do you do then when it's sitting on your credit report\
Well in that case and I and I urge you to I urge you to try to find a\
low-budget attorney that can help you negotiate it but if you absolutely cannot afford it which I understand cuz\
you know times are hard now then what you can do is you can call the IRS on the phone Now I know that seems spooky\
Don't freak out quite yet because anytime I've ever had to call the IRS usually for some business thing some EIN\
in you know issue or whatever the case may be But I've also had students my credit students in particular that will\
call the IRS And in all of the instances when I call the IRS this is what I get I\
get somebody who's again overworked underpaid They've been you know diminishing these\
IRS and other government departments and they're just as tired and fed up with\
everything as you are right So you have to understand that you're not dealing with the IRS So get this in your mind\
This is a mentality mental shift here for you You're dealing with a person on the other end of that phone right And so\
when you think in terms of I'm dealing with a person you think okay what's the best way I can deal with a person How\
would I want to be treated Well you want to be treated with respect Okay Don't take out all of the life and times of\
your IRS issues on the one person that answers the phone to help you Please don't because it's not going to help you\
at all and it's not fair to that person Yes they work for the IRS and the IRS overall sucks but it's again an\
individual you're dealing with So my recommendation to you is to be as nice as possible Just say "I've run into some\
hard times." Be as forthright as possible because people like honesty And they also understand that people are\
going through a hell of a time right now So you just say "I've I've gone through some major you know issues." Maybe I\
mean don't go into too much detail but maybe you had a medical problem Maybe you were in a coma for months Maybe\
you know you had a car accident and you had to go through physical therapy for six months or a year Explain the situation Just say "I fell behind You\
know I know I owe this debt um I would like to pay because IRS debt does not fall off Okay so this is one of those\
rare situations where you admit to the debt because you can't get out of it Okay unless you die of course which we\
don't want that to happen So we know that you got to pay that right So\
knowing that you have to pay that you admit to it say yes I understand that I owe it What can I do to fix the\
situation What are my options And then they'll explain well we can set up a payment plan and this and that and this\
and that when they roll out the options what's which they're going to roll out for you They're going to say "Well how much do you think you can afford every\
month?" And you tell them "Well bucks a month or whatever the case may be." And you might be you know not getting Starbucks that month or whatever the\
case may be but everybody can usually scrape together $a month at least maybe even $a month to try to get\
this caught up And so what you want to do is even even if you have to go collect cans or whatever go ahead and do\
it just to try to get this squared away Now here's the important part to this is that when you are on the phone\
negotiating with the IRS yourself just say "I would really love to start the payment plan but I would like it if you\
could put it in writing that number one this is our payment plan and this is a the agreed period of time in which I\
will be making these payments to cover this agreed debt but I would like to have you take it off my personal\
credit." Just say "It's been affecting me I can't get a decent car loan I can't rent an apartment I can't do whatever."\
just give them the whole you know crying eyes you know story right And usually what they'll do is they'll say "Okay\
well what we'll do is we'll wait till you make like three or four payments in a row without skipping any or being late\
on any." And typically what'll happen is yes the IRS will take the entire debt\
off your personal credit reports all three of them Okay It works every time\
I've had so many people do it this way They don't think it's going to work They're like "I'm dealing with the IRS they don't care blah blah blah That's\
not the case Remember what I said mentality shift right You're dealing with an individual when you talk to somebody on the phone And so they are\
usually good I know it's a government agency and people are like I don't think they're going to do this They will do it\
because they want to get paid just like anybody else And if they know that this little minuscule monthly payment plan is\
the only way to start getting you to pay something it's better than nothing And you can also negotiate off all the\
interest and all the you know fines and all that other stuff You can also negotiate that down on your own as well\
And it would start with a conversation of well what's the core debt Like what's the core tax debt And then you can start\
negotiating you know getting rid of all the interest and all the fees and the fines as well And you can do this on\
your own Give yourself some credit to be able to handle this on your own\
especially if you can't afford an attorney or you don't have a massive tax obligation to whereas you need an\
attorney Like if you owe tens of thousands of dollars you probably want to have an attorney involved But if you owe like less than maybe even less\
than then you might want to start this strategy and do the strategy See how far you get Now if you get somebody\
who completely shuts you down and says "No I'm not doing it this way," or "Screw you," which sometimes you do when you call the IRS Well then you're\
probably going to have to consider getting yourself a tax attorney to help you out with the negotiation process and that would be the best step But at least\
you tried right So that's how you deal with IRS debt And yes it does work And\
yes I know it's scary to call the IRS but remember you're not calling the the nameless faceless boogeyman You are\
actually calling an individual who's going to be having a hard day and they're working their ass off and they're just not happy with their job\
and they're not happy with the cutbacks and they're thinking that they might get laid off any second now and they're going through their own stuff too They\
also know how hard things are in society and how how people are going through hard times And if you are nice to them and you are forthright and honest you'll\
be shocked at how far you can get with the IRS Trust me on this okay I know it's hard to trust the government but\
trust me on this I've worked with so many people who've been able to pull this off and they're shocked They they get back to me and they're like "Monica\
this actually worked." Yeah because you're not dealing with the IRS you're dealing with an individual Now like I\
said once in a while you'll get that you know bad apple but for the most part they're pretty good people And I found that the people that work in the IRS are\
not only helpful they seem really tired and if you're just willing to extend a little bit of nicity toward them then\
they will literally um bend over backwards for you and that's what you want So just be nice damn it Just be\
nice you know No need to be be all upset It's not their fault They didn't do this to you So just be as nice as possible\
and as honest as possible And that brings me finally to child support Now\
this is a loaded topic for me and let me tell you why It's because uh my daughter she will be an adult next year and I\
have been a one-man band single parent for the last almost years Okay I\
divorced her dad when when she was um not just just under two So he's been a\
dead beatat since day one and that's why I got a divorce because he didn't want to get a job And after all the excuses\
for years I decided I did not want my daughter to be raised in a household where she saw mommy working her ass off\
every day and daddy sitting around and playing video games or watching TV Okay\
So I decided that kids pick up what they see rather than what you tell them And\
so I decided that I didn't want her to see that And I did not want her to think that that's okay So that's why I filed for divorce So ever since then I am the\
one man ban financially for her and he has not put in anything And in addition that in addition to that we were in the\
state of California LA County and he probably is hovering around $in\
back child support And so this is a loaded topic for me because I have a lot\
of men in particular who ask me in the comments section how they can get out of\
their child support And I have to be honest with you guys in particular\
you know pay for your damn kids okay I mean you help bring them into the world\
Pay for them damn kids All right Because I've been fighting this for years And as\
far as me getting paid which even the poultry amount that he's actually supposed to be paying as per his court\
order is such a small amount compared to what it actually takes to raise a young lady I've kicked in so much money to be\
able to get this girl over the finish line And I'm going to continue paying probably well into her adulthood because\
things are so difficult for young people to be able to launch into the real world these days We both know that So I have a\
sensitive spot And if you can find a way to get back to and communicate with the\
baby mama because we know it's mostly the dudes that want to get out of this child support thing then you can start\
the negotiation process with her And there's a good chance that you might\
be able to have the courts reverse all this crap that's on your personal credit when it comes to child support Some\
states will do it some counties will do it Well they'll allow you to have a personal um agreement with the s former\
significant other the the the parent of the situation And other counties are just like "Nope sorry You've already\
proven to be a dead beat so now it's our problem to rake you over the coals." And they will So see if there's a county if\
you're in a county where they will allow you to communicate with the with the baby mama say in this situation\
and you need to be able to see if you can get her to agree to some other\
payment plan and then the county will then be able to take it off your credit because you could show\
some kind of payments But you do have to go through the county though to to make sure that they're taking out taken out\
of the situation as a debt collector So you're going to have to do some communication with the county and you\
might even have to drag baby mama down there and have to sign whatever paperwork the county requires to whereas\
they're going to be taken off the hook on the collection part of it Not every county will participate Every county has\
a different way of doing this So that's why I can't tell you exactly how this works but the first conversation is with baby mama to see if she'll even agree to\
it in the beginning in the first place and many times you probably won't Okay so if that's the case how else can you\
have this removed off your personal credit Well there's a dispute process which you know again is a shot It's not\
necessarily going to come off your credit but you could try to dispute it with Experian Equifax and TransUnion You\
could say it's inaccurate information and needs to be investigated You could also do the envelope strategy where you\
send a certified letter So this is after the first days investigation period with Experian Equifax TransUnion If\
nothing happens to positively and favorably update this on your credit report then you need to send this with a\
letter a debt validation letter which again I now have available to you at\
getdisputellets.com which is down below You can get that letter put it in this envelope Can be a number envelope\
Doesn't have to be this big And you send one of these to the court to the actual courthouse they sign for this and then\
they're going to have to validate the debt Now if they're not able to come up with any legitimate validation which\
sometimes they're not sometimes they don't respond at all or they give you something halfass like a statement\
remember what I talked about with statements that statements don't count folks Okay So if they if you get this\
back say they signed for this on the st and it's the th and you didn't receive\
anything or you didn't receive anything valid as per federal law then you send a\
copy of this and you send a copy of the letter that was in here to Experian\
Equifax and TransUnion in a dispute letter saying "Hey I sent this letter to\
the courthouse." And this also applies to bankruptcies too by the way I sent this to the courthouse Somebody signed\
for it on the first Here we are on I would say the st or the st of the following month It's been more than \
days I've gotten nothing They are in violation of federal law and all the statutes are located in your dispute\
letters And because they did not respond then this needs to be removed off my personal credit So the problem though\
with certain kinds of debt like for example if you had a credit card a defaulted credit card that fell off your\
credit and say ABC Collection Agency bought that debt and they put it back on your credit report if you could show proof that it came off which is why I\
tell everybody to save save every scrap of paper you get from the credit bureaus and pay basically anybody in this\
process because if you could prove that it fell off as per federal law they can't put it back on your credit because\
it's already come off right Even if it's a different collection agency if it's the same originating debt they cannot\
put it back on your personal credit reports Okay So it's different though with student loans and it's different\
with even the IRS but it's also different with you know child support So\
they can continue putting it it can continue bouncing back on your credit So\
please be warned that that might be the case That might actually end up happening to you And don't be shocked and don't be amazed And of course you\
could always try to go back and dispute saying "Hey wait a minute This already fell off days ago Here's proof that you guys took it off take it off because\
and you could try the whole federal law thing Sometimes they might do it Sometimes they might take it back off again Sometimes they might not But don't\
be surprised if it doesn't stay off because with student loans with child support and with the IRS or other even\
state tax obligations that stuff usually doesn't stay off It'll it'll keep coming back on which is why you want to get\
ahead of these types of things These are the three the three things that you're going to have to try to figure out how\
to how you can make good on so that you can you know either have it completely removed like the child support you want\
that removed completely or IRS debt you want that completely removed or even\
state tax obligations completely removed or if it's a student loan situation you want it to positively update on your\
personal credit reports as in the consolidation strategy that I that I showed you before So that is the way to\
get these hard difficult things off your credit And yeah it's probably not the song and dance you wanted to hear You\
probably wanted to hear how I can you know give you a magic wand and you can just make it all disappear But that's not the reality So if you're\
one of these people and you're like "Well Monica I really need to start making some more money so I can sub you know send in the child support payments\
or the IRS payments or whatever the case may be\
NEW $K EASY APPROVAL LINE OF CREDIT! LOW INCOME AND BAD FICO ACCEPTED! GRADUATE TO UNSECURED FAST!\
we're\
going to be going over the Bank of\
America cash secured line of credit Now\
this is different from their traditional\
secured business line of credit and the\
requirements are much easier So if\
you're a newer business you can still\
qualify for that But before we dive into\
this I just wanted to differentiate from\
their actual secured business line of\
Traditional Secured Business Line of Credit Requirements\
credit So Bank of America has always had\
their secured business line of credit\
Now the secured business line of credit\
you still had to meet certain criteria\
So right here minimum years in\
business under existing ownership and a\
minimum of\
$in annual revenue So their\
traditional secured business line of\
credit knocks a lot of small businesses\
or even newer businesses out of the game\
because for one you need to be in\
business for at least years and you\
need to be generating\
$Now the cash secured line of\
Differences Between Traditional and Cash Secured Lines of Credit\
credit is a little bit different So with\
the cash secured line of credit you can\
build and strengthen your credit while\
growing your business So this is going\
to be for small businesses with at least\
in annualized revenue and \
months in business So as you can see the\
requirements are much more lenient than\
their traditional secure business line\
of credit You only need to have \
versus\
in months time in business\
versus two years time in business Now\
now right here it says graduate to an\
unsecured line over time security\
deposit starting at $So the\
minimum to put down is and you can\
graduate to an unsecured business line\
of credit over time So the path to the\
Steps to Graduate to an Unsecured Line of Credit\
unsecured line of credit first you're\
going to apply online So you apply and\
fund your account with a minimum deposit\
of $And then number two you're\
going to keep growing your business So\
use your line of credit for operating\
expenses payroll and make regular\
payments to establish positive account\
history And then step three graduate to\
an unsecured line So after a successful\
review of your account performance your\
deposit will be refunded Account reviews\
begin at months So you could\
essentially graduate from a secured cash\
line of credit to an unsecured business\
line of credit within months So when\
you make regular on-time payments to\
build your business credit after years\
in business under existing ownership and\
in annual revenue you can\
transition to an unsecured line of\
credit Your credit line is also\
refundable So if your primary goal is to\
build business credit your small\
business can start with a security\
deposit as low as And you could\
close the account at any time simply by\
paying off the balance Once the account\
has been closed your security deposit\
will be refunded Now again the minimum\
line amount is $And this does come\
with a $annual fee but this is waved\
for the first year So if you eventually\
transition to an unsecured account then\
it's not going to cost you anything\
because again it's waved in the first\
year and you come up for review to an\
unsecured card after the first months\
There's also no origination fees Now\
Comparison of Different Line of Credit Options\
let's compare some of the different line\
of credit options right so you have your\
business advantage credit line So this\
is going to be the unsecured account And\
then you have the business advantage\
credit line cash secured So you do have\
to put down cash to secure the account\
Now with the other secured line of\
credit you don't necessarily have to\
secure it with cash You can secure it\
with business assets But again that's\
for more established businesses Now when\
comparing these accounts right so again\
for the unsecured account years time\
in business for the cash secured line of\
credit only months Minimum sales is\
going to be and the prior annual\
gross sales And this is for the\
unsecured For the secured is going to be\
The cash secured business line of\
credit also has a path to graduation to\
an unsecured option So again this is a\
way for you to transition from secured\
to unsecured Now some of the top\
Frequently Asked Questions\
frequently asked questions How is my\
credit line determined the credit line\
amount is equal to the cash security\
deposit that you provide The minimum\
required deposit is\
$Also how do I graduate to an\
unsecured line of credit so they will\
periodically evaluate your cash secured\
line of credit for eligibility for an\
unsecured business advantage credit line\
When you meet lending standards for the\
unsecured line of credit they will\
refund your security deposit Now I also\
just wanted to distinguish the cash\
secured line of credit versus the\
secured business line of credit These\
are two different products So the\
requirements for the secured business\
line of credit again minimum annual\
revenue of\
and at least years under the\
current owner business ownership Now\
Recap and Final Thoughts\
just to recap so Bank of America now\
offers three different business lines of\
credit So they have the traditional\
unsecured business line of credit that\
requires two years time in business and\
then you also have the secured business\
line of credit that also requires two\
years time in business but also\
$in annual revenue Now with the\
cash secured line of credit this is\
going to be open for newer businesses\
that are at least months old and have\
in annual gross revenues Now this\
is going to open the door for a lot of\
small businesses because one of the big\
complaints I hear all the time is that a\
lot of businesses can't get access to\
business lines of credit because they\
don't have those two years time in\
business or usually years of business\
tax returns to qualify at most\
commercial banks So overall I think this\
is a gamecher by Bank of America cuz not\
only will you have access to a line of\
credit a business line of credit that\
will help you with building your\
business credit And what's also unique\
is that this cash secured line of credit\
also has a path to graduation So you\
could eventually transition to an\
unsecured line of credit where you\
actually get your security deposit back\
and also potentially get a credit limit\
increase Now from my understanding this\
may be one of the only secured business\
lines of credit or cash secured lines of\
credit on the business side that have a\
path to graduation Now one of the\
differences between a secured business\
line of credit versus a secured credit\
card for example is that with a secured\
business line of credit you're able to\
withdraw or draw down on the full amount\
of the line of credit So it's\
essentially just the same as almost\
having money in your checking account So\
you have full access to the funds So\
even though you're putting down the\
deposit you still have % access You\
can pull the entire amount off So\
overall I think this is an absolute\
gamecher especially for newer businesses\
to not only build business credit also\
have access to your money and build a\
banking relationship with one of the top\
financial institutions in the country\

also can consider other things like\
annual business revenue and years in\
business how long You' been around well\
business credit reports are public\
information some borrowers may prefer\
not to have personal credit during the\
application process that way your credit\
score doesn't go down because of an\
inquiry as well right whether it's\
because you're worried about lowering\
ing your credit score or being\
disqualified for funding or because you\
don't want a hard pool to result on a\
temporarily lowering your score for as\
much as years for a loan you don't\
even get that applies to you then you\
want to hear about these four small\
business loans that don't require a\
credit check and will consider\
applications with a low credit score not\
to mention if you're a sole proprietor\
that's just you under your social you\
can also get different loans for that as\
well so it can be be your personal\

business entity it's just you I look at\
loan amounts repayment periods and also\
business inquiries when you apply to\
make sure that these are good ones for\
you guys so I I dare I narrowed it down\
so that you don't have to chase after\
the thousands of lenders that are out\
there we narrowed it down so that you\
can just take a look at these four\
that'll work for you now some lenders\
may still ask you for your credit\
history but they may not use it to\
determine your eligibility a lot of\
times it's just trying to get to know\
who you are and with the to \
different lenders that I look at these\
are the four that are awesome for this\
situation the first one I've got for you\
is called Kaa K IA Kaa is unique in that\
it uses a crowdfunding like all of you\
platform that specialized in providing\
small business loans without a minimum\
credit score required they pull little a\
little money from a little bit from\
everybody and they offer a more\
inclusive opportunity for entrepreneurs\
who may not meet the criteria for\
traditional loans based on credit score\
because we determine based on that crowd\
funding with a maximum funding limit of\
$Kaa caters particularly well to\
businesses with a modern modest startup\
expenses the platform operates on a\
peer-to-peer that's like you and me\
right like that's how it works Lending\
model where borrowers engage their\
personal networks people you even know\
to secure the initial funding within\
-day period so you'll put it out your\
friends and family can be part of this\
pool and then they'll launch it to\
everybody followed by this phase of\
going to your personal Network Kea\
broadens the scope by introducing the\
campaign to a network of lenders\
facilitating the acquisition of these\
microloans critical for business\
operations to your friends and family\
can help you get loans from lenders\
because that they're putting a little\
bit in and these lenders go you know\
what if they trust you I think we'll\
trust you one of aa's distinguishing\
features is its transparency regarding\
business credit reports lenders on the\
platform do not have access to borrowers\
business credit reports nor is that\
information publicly displayed to the\
borrowers that ke a loan profile so\
you're not going to be found out by all\
your friends about you know your score\
this approach offers a level of privacy\
for you focused on the business idea and\
the borrowers Network support rather\
than strict credit matters it's a social\
lending platform it only happens now in\
this crazy social media Road right to\
qualify for Kea loans applications must\
be years and older and have their own\
business operation in the United States\
these are for US citizens and US\
businesses loan amounts can reach up to\
that $and repayment terms can be\
over a period of years offering\
flexibility in managing your loan\
obligations so that you can afford the\
monthly payment now Kea stands out as a\
viable funding option for small\
businesses emphasizing community support\
and your friends will know that you're\
in business accessibility and\
flexibility as far as those loan terms\
and paying it back the next one I've got\
to talk about is credibility and and\
this is spelled credit Billy yeah c r e\
d i b l y and it offers small business\
loans with a reli relatively low minimum\
credit score requiring of that's\
pretty low right although applicants\
should be aware that the lower credit\
score May still lead to a higher\
interest rate again Kaa isn't looking at\
credit this one to get in this club\
this accessibility Factor makes credible\
an appealing option for borrowers\
concerned about traditional lending\
stricter credit criterias because\
they've lowered the bar to be able to\
let you in and get this you're not going\
to believe the amounts the amounts I\
think are wild from $to $,\
providing stability stable financial\
support for businesses of all varying\
scales who couldn't use\
$well we just funded that last\
Saturday we Angel funded a business\
which we're really excited about tilt\
which is cool so anyway that's another\
that's another video besides credit\
scores credible evaluates the overall\
Financial Health of the business during\
the application process considering\
factors that are Beyond just the credit\
score requirements they want to know\
more however to qualify businesses must\
determine a consistent monthly cash flow\
you got to have\
$showcasing Financial stability\
and repayment capacity meaning you got\
to have some cash flow now eligibility\
requirements for credible loans include\
being based in the United States\
maintaining a credit score of and\
higher and ensuring that that minimum\
monthly Revenue hits that threshold of\
$that's the total amount you\
could be paying out in expenses\
but you got to have coming in\
loan terms offered by credibility spam\
from to months allowing borrowers\
flexibility and managing the repayment\
schedule according to business cash flow\
and of course your specific needs\
credible emphasis on businesses health\
and cash flow provides a path for\
businesses to access that necessary\
capital and funding to grow your\
operation and help with whatever your\
needs are they're there to help you next\
up we got to talk about one of my\
favorites we love this this came out of\
Elon Musk Empire PayPal PayPal's working\
capital loan stands out at its unique\
repayment structure making it a\
practical choice for businesses\
leveraging PayPal as a payment platform\
and I bet you soon X will be providing\
loans I'm just saying elans always\
wanted to be the bank of banks the\
digital bank so we'll see if he\
accomplished that but PayPal their loan\
repayment integrates with your sales\
revenue on PayPal they're able to see\
like what your selling the payment\
platform automatically deducts a\
percentage of your sales until the loan\
is cleared so you don't even have to\
worry about like making a payment\
they'll just take it out of what your\
sales are so easy and seamless PayPal\
accessibility eligibility for this is\
based on your PayPal Salle history\
rather than conducting a traditional\
credit check offering accessibility from\
the wide range of borrowers they just\
look at like are you selling on PayPal\
because they're making a little bit on\
whatever you're selling right so they\
give you working capital that entails\
repaying a minimum of to or % of\
the total loan amount along with a fixed\
fee every days until the loan is\
fully repaid you also are able to keep\
the flexibility to make additional\
payments at any time without incurring\
uh prepayment penalties like if you're\
paid off early upon approval of the\
application and the agreement of terms\
funding and depositing into your PayPal\
account see it streamlines the entire\
buing process like it's just so simple\
just shows up there it's amazing and to\
qualify for this loan businesses must\
have a PayPal account premium or a\
business account that you got to be\
around for at least days ensuring the\
stability of history with the platform\
that's only days so if you're not\
started start Additionally the annual\
PayPal Sals must meet specific\
thresholds with a minimum of $\
for Premium Accounts and for\
business accounts the loan amounts range\
from to initially with the\
potential for a higher amount of \
for repeat lenders now the last one I'm\
going to talk about is an amazing one I\
love them they've been around for a\
while they are square you can get a loan\
with square which is pretty amazing\
square loans offer a convenient and\
accessible Financial option for\
businesses using Square and like PayPal\
square is squaring up the deal right\
with it sets Square loans apart is that\
they automatically repay they have a\
repayment system where a small portion\
of your daily sales from Square accounts\
goes back to repaying the loan balance\
so you don't feel it right this seamless\
process it eliminates the need for\
manual payments and keeps constant\
progress towards that debt clearance as\
well as not messing up your credit cuz\
they're going to take care of you unlike\
traditional loans that look at your\
credit score Square considers various\
business factors such as your account\
history processing volume and your\
payment fre fre quency to determine\
eligibility now to qualify for square\
loans businesses must be active a square\
seller leveraging Square payment\
processing and of course they're making\
a little bit of money off that loan\
amounts range from bucks to\
accommodating businesses of\
different sizes and of course whatever\
your financial needs are these loans are\
structured with a flat fee rather than\
ongoing interest payments to make\
payments considerable so they make it\
simple and you can see it and you can\
understand it pretty easily Square loans\
do not entail late fees or additional\
hidden charges making it easier for\
people to borrow money and actually\
trust them it's almost like the Costco\
approach right the repayment timeline\
for square loans requires full repayment\
in months offering a reasonable time\
frame for businesses to manage and clear\
those debt obligations so that you can\
get rid of them now this structured\
approach aligns with business cash flow\
Revenue cycles that keep going like\
monthly maintaining Financial so it does\
does strain you and it supports your\
stable growth here so that they can grow\
your business the idea is that they give\
you Capital when you need it even though\
you don't know that you need it they\
actually give you the access so you can\
start buying more stuff to sell right\
overall when you're shopping around for\
small business loans and have a higher\
credit score with that that you can\
qualify there might be favorable rates\
and terms for those type of loans\
although if you have a low credit score\
it isn't the end of the world these are\
the places to go and they're more that\
I'll cover if you stick around on the\
channel and if you PR prefer to shop\
with lenders right that don't run your\
credit check you still have options\

I would tell you this just keep that in\
mind because what I'm going to help with\
you especially like I said getting into\
the real estate game just keep that in\
mind all right\
now you also have PNC okay so with PNC\
they have the cash unlimited\
now this here credit card gives you \
months on balance transfers right so\
when you get the card that $card\
or more that you can transfer the\
balance over to your checking account\
all right so they would use Experian\
FICO all right now that's the bank PNC\
Bank\
now the next card\
I would say is BCU baxter Credit Union\
okay so they have a cash rewards card\
starts at $\
now that's a Vantage three okay that's a\
Vantage um\
TransUnion okay now\
to forgive me i'm a little excited um\
now\
the next one is your Navy Federal Cash\
Rewards starts at $\
okay\
now again\
pay attention because these credit cards\
are um\
Visa usually Visa now here's the thing\
about it with with a Navy Federal okay\
that cash rewards it can be Visa\
Mastercard\
now remember trying to get you all in\
the real estate game so pay attention\
here's the thing about it with Navy\
Federal credit cards you actually\
can\
liquidate that card over to a debit card\
okay the prepaid debit card the go card\
right you all hear me talk about it all\
right so but it has to be the Visa\
Mastercard you can't do it with the Navy\
Federal U more rewards at American\
Express that's not the card to get don't\
go after that card all right so with\
Navy Federal we all know they use\
TransUnion okay transunion FICO all\
right so a low hanging fruit is what I'm\
paying attention to with these cards\
most of these cards now here's the thing\
about it uh we have another one on the\
list and I'm going to talk about that\
one in a minute\
let's think about it that means that\
you're okay with adding on your\
authorized users right and your rental\
payments okay your uh utility bills okay\
many of you may not even be aware that\
you can actually uh help aid your credit\
file not only with the authorized users\
and the uh utility bills many people are\
not even aware of that utility bills but\
you would have to go through um Identity\
IQ okay you would have to go through\
Identity IQ what I'mma do is I'mma sit\
here at this barbecue grill place\
so\
waiting on my m my wife and my daughter\
to get uh ready all right so\
like I said with uh Identity IQ\
you can actually um\
aid your credit file okay with with the\
utilities all right so that's the reason\
why that's important all right now\
let's talk about the last one all right\
and that's the State Department Federal\
Credit Union all right now they have a\
premium cash card okay cash cash card\
and it's a Experian mortgage score now\
here's the thing about it that most\
people are not aware of\
i keep telling people that you do need\
to know your mortgage score because\
there are credit unions out in the\
market that are willing to work with you\
okay but you need to know your mortgage\
score all right and so in order for you\
to do that you would have to go to my\
FICO i'll put a link in the description\
uh for you to check that out or you when\
you click on the go look for a loan you\
would see it there if you pull that and\
you want me to do an analysis\
of your uh personal credit you schedule\
a one-on-one consultation and I'll\
actually show you how to use the system\
and I will go over some of the uh credit\
unions you may want to look at depending\
on your scores okay so that's the reason\
why I'm sharing that with you that's the\
reason I tell people whenever you're\
looking for money you always want to use\
that system because % of the uh banks\
use that system all right now here's the\
thing about it people know all right\
let's just say focusing on the credit\
unions you also have PinFed okay so with\
PinFed I always tell people to go for\
the gold card okay the reason is because\
it gives you months on balance\
transfers okay um they don't charge a\
transfer fee all right now just helping\
you get access to the cash cuz I know\
some of you are like "Okay where does\
the real estate come in at?" But think\
about it let's uh state department and\
like I said these credit unions mainly\
with the credit unions all right once\
they do the hard pull on the credit and\
I'm telling you if you hovering about a\
cuz some of these credit unions will\
work with you with a okay uh like I\
said just depends especially like with a\
advantage score or Navy Federal car as\
many of us know that they usually\
depending on the relationship they\
usually will work with you with a lower\
score than that okay so the credit\
unions when they do a hard pull on your\
credit okay you can use that hard pull\
usually\
to apply for other loans okay whether it\
be a car loan or a personal loan now the\
personal loan I would do and the credit\
union that I would make a priority is is\
with State Department Federal Credit\
Union okay and the reason is is because\
not only that $credit card but\
they will also give you up to a $\
personal loan okay or a line of credit\
now that's very important and the reason\
it's very important because they give\
you up to days to make your first\
payment\

\'a0I'm going to break down\
what are tier one accounts how to use\

Terry I'm a support entrepreneur a\
mother a YouTuber but more importantly I\
have over years experience and I\
specialize in helping you get big money\
to six and seven figures so I would love\
for you to subscribe become part of our\
Terry's tips Community guys I'll do my\
nugget at the end so let me give you a\
real quick scenario let's say you are a\
business owner and you've been\
Incorporated you know for days let's\
say you have you know a credit score\
which let me help you out okay if you\
have a credit score and you have\
zero Revenue the big question right can\
you get business credit right now yes\
you actually can can you build business\
credit yes you actually can to be honest\
with you I recommend it that's a whole\
hack if you have bad personal credit a\
whole hack out here in these credit\
streams is to start building business\
credit because you can build it so much\
faster you get higher amounts it\
increases quickly and you could be\
building business credit while you're\
working on your personal credit okay now\
with bad personal credit and being a\
brand new business owner right and these\
are nuggets okay nuggets for my newbies\
I dropped like this to the entire video\
okay riff being a brand new business\
owner having bad personal credit and not\
having any Revenue are you getting a \
unsecured business line of credit no\
are you getting a business credit\
card no oh are you getting a you\
know I'm all business auto loan no but\
can you get some credit yes yes yes okay\
so let me break it down what it and real\
quick who should watch this video guys\
I'm not sure if you guys understand it\
if you've been incorporated or in\
business for less than five years you\
are still considered a new business a\
new business owner so if you are a new\
business owner you should watch this\
video if you're a new investor you\
should watch this video if you're\
somebody who needs additional streams of\
income you should watch this video if\
you're a seasoned investor a small\
business large business and you haven't\
been utilizing your business credit you\
haven't been leveraging your business\
credit you should watch this video and\
for even some of my vets you've been\
watching me for a while but you're still\
getting business credit denials guys\
some of this foundational stuff is what\
you're missing to get you to this next\
level so back to the basics okay you\
should be watching this video so let me\
explain what is a tier one account so\
for business credit you can build\
business credits super super quick\
regardless of personal credit using a\
tier system right it starts with tier\
one accounts and that's a group of\
accounts that you can get as a brand new\
business owner regardless of your\
personal credit regardless of Revenue\
they will approve you those are tier one\
accounts um and I'm going to give you\
some examples tier two accounts are\
accounts that are a little bit higher up\
so you can still get them with uh maybe\
being new you can still get them with\
possibly not even having some Revenue\
but they're going to have a little bit\
more requirements so depending on where\
you fall right how long you've been in\
business if you have any Revenue in at\
all what your personal credit is you may\
or may not be able to get tier two\
accounts then you have tier three and\
tier four so think about it guys like\
school right you have to pass grade\
number one to get the grade two if the\
past grade two to get to grade three the\
past grade three to get to grade four\
that was a nugget I need y'all I'm gonna\
teach you today right because many of\
you guys say well I have some tier one\
accounts how do I know when to move on\
to tier two the real answer is that when\
your tier one accounts are reporting to\
the business credit bureaus right which\
will give you a business credit profile\
and a business credit score then that\
means you should move on to tier two now\
why because the tier two accounts have a\
little bit of a higher requirement so\
you having those tier one accounts\
reporting is going to help you qualify\
for tier two gotta got it good real\
quick plug right here if all this sounds\
like you know gibberish to you invest in\
credit lovers lifestyle put the link in\
the description guys and or a strategy\
session right so let me give you an\
example for tier one accounts what are\
they because that's the tier system\
right you do some accounts in tier one I\
recommend four to five in tier one make\
sure that we're putting to the business\
credit bureaus then you move on to tier\
two then you move on to tier three all\
of that that process can take anywhere\
from days to days to days to a\
year or two years or three years now why\
do I say that because it's as fast as\
you go I did a whole video got like over\
um views right on how to get a\
business credit score a Payday score in\
one day right and you only need nugget\
right here four accounts reporting to\
the business credit bureaus to give you\
a business credit profile an initial\
profile and a business credit score well\
those four accounts you can do them in\
one day you can do them in an hour or\
you could do one a month for four months\
you could do one every three months you\
can do one once a week so it's some of\
this is how aggressive you are building\
how fast you do this how how um how much\
do you execute right you can go fast or\
you could go slow so tier one accounts\
and you'll also hear net and you'll\
also hear vendor tier one net vendor\
accounts guess what y'all they all the\
same thing like this video is every time\
for y'all they're all the same thing\
vendor accounts nugget I'm teaching you\
vendor accounts tier one account account\
and net s are all the same thing\
they're just calling them something\
different to confuse you and I'm going\
to give you guys some examples in this\
in this um in this in this video okay so\
a net account let me explain how it\
works let's say you are a brand new\
business owner and I'm going to use the\
example of you know Granger because\
that's one that just everybody knows\
about I'm going to give you some other\
examples you go to Granger that is a\
company they have a website they have\
all kinds of different supplies like\
cleaning supplies and office supplies\
and all of those things you go onto the\
website you order a bunch of items your\
brand new business owner okay you have\
bad personal credit and you have no\
revenue and you've been in business for\
like days you go on Granger's website\
you order a bunch of items at the\
checkout right at the checkout you can\
pay by you know credit cards you can pay\
by debit card sometimes you can pay by\
what like Google pay you can pay by\
Apple pay you can pay by PayPal you have\
all of these options to make it a net \
account or a vendor account or a here\
one account you're going to click\
invoice me now mind you depending on the\
company you're using is going to be\
somewhere where the actual option is\
going to be is going to be going to be\
different but you're going to click on\
invoice me what is that going to do that\
means the company is then going to\
invoice that means Granger is going to\
send an invoice to your company to pay\
for the items that you're ordering\
you're not paying for them at checkout\
so let's say you ordered I don't know\
um you order some cleaning supplies and\
some trash bags and some like fixtures\
and let's say it came to you know \
you're going to Granger's website you're\
ordering worth of items at the\
checkout instead of you paying with a\
credit card paying with a debit card\
paying with anything else you're\
clicking invoice me and then they're\
going to actually mail you the items\
with you paying zero dollars and zero\
cents and they are going to give you a\
net term so net is the most popular\
the most well-known term but I'm gonna\
break it down okay so net means is\
that they're going to mail you the items\
and you have days to pay the invoice\
and because you use Granger and they are\
a company that reports the business\
credit bureaus they will actually report\
like that little transaction like as an\
account you'll have an account with them\
they will report that to the business\
credit bureaus and that gives you what\
your very first trade line\
come on now I only said you'll leave me\
four so I said you could do it in one\
day they'd be confusing y'all okay so\
you'll have days to pay the actual\
item now nugget tier nugget here nugget\
here with net accounts you number One\
never default ever ever because business\
credit is not like personal credit where\
you have a bunch of Rights you can\
dispute a bunch of things and negotiate\
they're not playing with y'all they are\
businesses there is this is business to\
business right you're ordering from a\
business and you're a business owner so\
do not default on any items now you have\
days of pay it back the sooner you\
pay it back the better don't pay it on\
the th day the th day there's\
actually like the weight of the scoring\
models work and what they look at they\
look at how efficiently you pay your\
bills and how quickly you even pay them\
so let's say you have a net account\
you have days to pay it you get the\
items you pay the invoice in five days\
or ten days that's good the sooner you\
pay it the actually the better okay so\
that's a net account now let's say\
they have net terms that means\
they're going to mail you the items and\
you have days to pay it back so you\
hear a net account that means they're\
going to mail you the items and then you\
have days to pay it back now the\
reverse is true too I've seen a debt\
five a net seven a net that means\
they're going to mail you the items and\
you have days to pay it back that all\
that's all it is y'all okay so that's a\
tier one account that's a vendor account\
that's a net whatever whatever net\
terms it just means you're ordering\
items from a business a business credit\
vendor okay and they're mailing you the\
items and their invoice in your company\
and when that type of transaction takes\
place they report it to the business\
credit bureaus as an account they\
actually give you like a limit too so\
I've had people who you know do a couple\
of things the fundability and\
credibility again investing credit\
leverage lifestyle and they've gotten a\
Granger account and Granger's approved\
them for like five thousand dollars ten\
thousand dollars this is where like in\
within the very first days of you\
being a business owner you have five\
thousand dollars to spend on all these\
items and it's you're not coming your\
pocket right away\
come on someone you have to crawl before\
you walk and your goal is to have at\
least four of those reporting to have a\
score now guess what the hack is they\
don't check your personal credit they\
don't do a hard inquiry they don't\
report to personal they specifically\
report to business credit so this is why\
you see these clickbait videos get\
business credit with no no bad credit\
and no Revenue but they're not talking\
about big money they fooling y'all\
they're talking about tier one accounts\
okay which you still need now let me\
give you another example I need y'all to\
hear this because a lot of you are\
Granger quill and you lined out okay\
they're not the only tier one accounts\
I'm gonna do something for y'all I\
didn't think I was gonna do if I'm gonna\
do something depending on when you're\
watching this video I'm going to list \
for free\
vendor accounts give me a minute\
because I do my videos the same day to\
put all the put all the um websites in\
there but I want to put vendor\
accounts in the description of this\
video okay make sure y'all give me some\
likes and some shares now you only need\
for the report out of accounts money\
there's more I'm gonna give you like \
like the most popular you can find four\
accounts that you can actually use\
nugget right here nugget guys you need\
this so many of you guys want you know a\
ten thousand dollar business card and\
then you get you can't get that you can\
only get like a tier one or a tier two\
account and you're like this is not what\
I want I need I can't build business\
credit guys a lot of like the grandeurs\
that utilize the quills this is cleaning\
supplies this is a vacuum this is\
fixtures this is office supplies so let\
me give you an example I have a Granger\
account I've had since for forever when\
covid-happened do y'all remember when\
all the stores they had no hand\
sanitizer no soap um no Lysol none of\
those things and even when you went\
online you had to be like a hospital\
sometimes to get supplies well guess\
what guess who had cases of Lifestyle\
cases of soap cases of hand sanitizer\
how because I ordered them on bulk\
during covid-with my business vendor\
account\
I'm also a real estate investor I have\
ordered sump pumps I've ordered\
humidifiers like and mind you think\
outside the box it's gonna be part of my\
nugget right for some of these tier\
accounts guys think about how can you\
use them now to help you so you're not\
using your own paycheck or how about you\
think about somebody else how about some\
of these School teachers could use hand\
sanitizer could use lotion could use you\
know tissues even some material accounts\
I'm going to outline for you guys have\
office supplies you know how many\
teachers make like very low salaries and\
they're buying like markers and pens and\
notebooks on their own well could you\
bless a school a YMCA a shelter your\
church right who I can't use cleaning\
supplies in a house what investor can't\
use trash bags and trash cans and some\
pumps I've ordered um printers scanners\
um ink cartilages come on somebody right\
and so my point to that guys is that\
there's only certain items you can use\
and you can order with the tier one\
accounts but there's something for\
everybody so instead of saying I want\
this this other thing and thinking tier\
one accounts are not for you you need\
them if you have no business credit you\
need them if you have no Revenue you\
need them if you have bad personal\
credit you need them if you're trying to\
build business credit right and you can\
get in one month come on\
somebody so think about how you can\
actually use them to help benefit your\
life or somebody else's life okay that's\
tier one accounts now how you use them I\
actually already explained it right you\
order from the actual websites you get\
the items and then you just make sure\
you pay the in ways back on time and\
even pay it early how does it help you\
it gives you a business credit profile\
immediately it gives you a business\
credit score immediately it gives you\
trade lines immediately and those things\
right there help you then qualify for\
what the business line of credit the\
business credit card the business auto\
loan right so take away right now let me\
give you some examples so I wrote some\
of these down right so obviously\
everybody knows about quill and Granger\
Uline but there's also a business\
t-shirt Club there's even Crown office\
supplies Sumo office supplies nav which\
I have a whole video on nav there are\
monitoring system they actually have a\
business Boost account where they will\
report to the business credit bureaus\
and monitor your business credit reports\
and give you two of your personal credit\
scores\
and reports and help you with funding\
options you can actually use that while\
you're building business credit and the\
report to the business credit bureaus\
um even let me see they're even saying\
like uh Capital One Sparks classic is\
like a tier one account now nugget right\
here guys business credit is fluid the\
lenders can and they will change their\
requirements I could give you \
accounts or tier one accounts today and\
three of them tomorrow because they were\
no longer reporting or change of\
requirements so what is the action item\
the Nugget here right is you as the\
business business owner take\
responsibility go on their website and\
see are they still a tier one are they\
still a net what do they need to\
report right because your goal right is\
not only just to have a bunch of vendor\
accounts but to specifically use lenders\
that report to the business credit\
bureau don't give y'all some real stuff\
in this video another nugget there's\
thousands of tier one accounts and\
thousands of business credit bureau um\
business credit\
um vendor accounts but a very very very\
small amount however like five percent\
actually report to the bureaus so your\
nugget is is you want tier one accounts\
vendor accounts net accounts but you\
want to specifically use companies that\
report to the business credit bureaus so\
it helps you qualify for more money\
faster so they change the requirements\
sometimes quill can say no you order one\
time for a hundred dollars and we'll\
report and in three months they can say\
you order two times for a month uh\
seventy five dollars and then we'll\
actually go ahead and report right so do\
your due diligence pick them up hey I'm\
a new business owner I'm ordering from\
your website what do you need to report\
to the business credit bureaus what\
bureaus do you report to and if they say\
hey you just need one order fifty\
dollars will you do one order of fifty\
dollars now the other nugget right here\
guys is four vendor accounts you just\
need them to report you don't gotta keep\
on using them over and over again once\
the reporting you're good so some of you\
guys are like ordering from like\
Ranger and quill and Uline and business\
t-shirt Club every a single month stop\
you only once it's reported to the\
bureau you're good guys even wise\
business plans I did a whole video on\
SBA financing and how to qualify as a\
startup and even Venture capitalists\
that would give you money it's a whole\
different video right for your business\
and a lot of times they require what a\
business plan well many of you guys\
don't know how to do what write a\
business plan there's a tier one vendor\
called wise business plan\
you can use that tier one account get\
them to write your business plan to help\
you qualify for more money for your\
business and that actual account will\
report to the bureaus and help you\
qualify for more money\
bars okay so I hope that that was\
helpful I explained what tier one\
accounts are how to use them how they\
help you I gave you some examples and I\
want to even put some examples in the\
description of this video\
um for my nugget guys I need you to\
think outside the box like there is more\
than one way to get to the goal and\
that's even like the example I gave with\
these tier one accounts when covid-\
happened and I got a whole case I got a\
whole video on it right a case of all\
these lifestyle supplies and stuff came\
and I started giving them away like\
they're like actually to my my son's two\
schools and stuff because they actually\
need like Lysol and they need to um like\
hand sanitizers and all those kinds of\
things guys that was a way for me to\
leverage my business credit and help\
somebody else even now guys like I can\
qualify for anything but some of my like\
tier accounts that I still have like\
they'll have bulk amounts of things at\
cheaper prices guys I'm a numbers person\
if I can get it from Walmart or Target\
or Home Depot for one price or I can get\
it from Uline or Granger or quill office\
furniture some bumps humidifiers\
fixtures office chairs printers scanners\
stop it y'all right if I can get those\
things for a cheaper price I still use\
my vendor account sometimes if their\
price is better so my point even some of\
the fleet cards guys are tier one\
accounts I think wax you a wax and Murph\
USA are gas cards in your business's\
name business Ein and they're tier one\
they don't check your personal credit\
and it won't go on your personal credit\
who can't use a gas card\
okay so part of being an entrepreneur is\
being resourceful part of being an\
entrepreneur is solving problems part of\
being an entrepreneur is having a goal\
and figuring your own way out there may\
not be a step-by-step system part of\
being an entrepreneur is thinking\
outside the box and part you may not\
even be yourself before your\
entrepreneur everybody is not meant to\
be a self-employed entrepreneur but\
everybody is meant to build wealth and\
if you only have one stream of income\
that's too close to zero\
so everybody should be doing something\
whether you have a full-time job and you\
have a couple of side hustles that you\
incorporate and then you build business\
credit whether you want to be a\
full-time uh self-employed entrepreneur\
it doesn't matter hands down business\
credit is one of the number one ways to\
leverage because you can put it faster\
it increases more quickly they have\
better terms and you don't have to use\
your personal credit\
NEW A.I. Deletes EVERYTHING From Credit Reports | Why Nobody Is Talking About This!\
this is the easiest and fastest way to\
increase your credit score guaranteed\
on today's video I'm going to truly\
expose how easy it is for anyone to fix\
their credit on their own using AI if\
you choose to i want to be really clear\
so everyone understands that AI is going\
to take over the entire credit repair\
industry across the United States this\
is truly the new wave how you can work\
on your credit on your own and anyone\
can do it the days of paying these\
bootleg credit repair companies hundreds\
and even thousands of dollars are over\
because now AI is allowing you to\
control the entire process on your own\
but let's be very clear about this this\
is definitely not Chat GPT because\
ChatGpt truly does not understand the\
entire credit reporting process yet in\
order for Chad GPT to be successful with\
this you have to feed it so many\
different prompts so many different\
letters so many different reports in\
order for it to become more advanced\
because Chad GPT has to figure out what\
works and what doesn't work and\
unfortunately it's not there cuz you're\
always going to hear people say on the\
internet "Oh I'll just fix my credit\
using Chad GBT." Well then do it fam\
show us exactly how you're going to do\
it from start to finish and it actually\
works nobody has ever done that they all\
say it's super simple but I want you to\
walk me through it and show me how to do\
it and show me that you're actually\
going to get good results from it that's\
the biggest part that they leave out is\
the results show me results it's very\
important to understand that Chad GPT\
also does not understand the different\
tactics of disputing because there are\
three different disputing tactics that\
can be used there's Metro compliance\
disputing there's consumer law and then\
there's factual disputing and nobody\
wants to admit that there's never been a\
software that can do all three until now\
i want everyone out there to understand\
everyone that's working on their credit\
that you are up against the machine at\
the credit reporting agencies the\
machine that they are using is called E\
Oscar this is exactly what is going to\
process your disputes and read your\
letters it's trying to figure out what\
exactly you're trying to say to the\
credit reporting agencies and its\
biggest job is to respond to you and the\
next step in what E Oscar does is it\
takes all of that information and it\
sends it to the creditor debt collector\
or whoever it is you're trying to\
communicate with you need to understand\
that E Oscar was designed to help the\
credit reporting agencies not you the\
consumer who is the actual borrower\
because understand the more that they\
can keep your credit score down the more\
the credit reporting agency makes from\
you the consumer because they can sell\
subprime lending information to all of\
these different companies and that's how\
the credit bureaus truly make money the\
credit bureaus don't make money from\
selling credit scores and credit reports\
they make money from people with bad\
credit because the longer they can keep\
your credit score down the more subprime\
lending products they can offer you\
meaning car loans with high interest\
rates credit cards with high interest\
rates home loans with high interest\
rates life just becomes super expensive\
and you can't afford it the credit\
reporting agencies are making billions\
of dollars from selling you subprime\
lending products they don't make\
billions of dollars from people like me\
with high credit scores they make money\
solely from people with bad credit i\
want you to understand that this is a\
billiondoll business and by the year of\
it's going to be a trillion dollar\
business and it's called big data they\
sell your personal information your bad\
credit to all the subprime lending\
companies that's how they're making all\
of this money and the credit reporting\
agencies are going to continue to make\
billions and trillions of dollars every\
single year as long as they can keep you\
down why do you think you get random\
text messages that say "Hey do you need\
a personal loan hey do you need a new\
car hey do you need better car insurance\
rates?" All of this information is\
coming from the big data industry that's\
why you're getting all of these offers\
and this is why it's important for you\
to work on your credit because the\
longer they can keep you down the more\
that they can keep you in those bad car\
loans the bad mortgage rates the bad\
credit cards continuously making money\
off of your bad credit it truly just\
turns into a life that just becomes\
unaffordable and I want to be really\
clear that this is not Chat GPT and it\
damn sure is not the bootleg credit\
Versio that gives you three basic\
template letters for just three credit\
reporting agencies and they damn sure\
don't attack the secondary bureaus and\
they don't attack the creditors directly\
and here's the even crazier part now\
they're selling it to other YouTubers\
other Tik Tockers other Instagrammers so\
now they're changing the name on it and\
selling you a different product for more\
money but it's the same damn thing and\
it's damn sure not the bootleg Dovely\
that is literally just going to only\
pull your credit reports from TransUnion\
so then it's just going to guess that\
it's on the other credit reporting\
agencies i mean who does that because\
it's basically making letters to dispute\
absolutely nothing and the even worse\
part these credit repair companies\
aren't telling you the truth that\
they're all using credit repair software\
because there's no way that they're\
going through every single credit report\
creating custom letters for every single\
person it's not possible they would have\
to have so many people working inside of\
a building going through credit reports\
creating letters and they don't because\
we all know that they're just lazy and\
they just don't care because it's\
absolutely impossible for any credit\
repair company to get to or\
even clients by looking at every\
single credit report and sending out\
custom letters for every single person\
it's just not possible you're always\
going to hear them say this this is the\
favorite like "Yeah man we're going to\
create some custom letters for you to\
make sure we take care of this no\
they're not the entire credit repair\
industry is using template letters\
they're using software they don't know\
how to fix credit and that's exactly why\
I helped create Dispies the most\
advanced AI credit repair software ever\
created it uses Metrocompliance\
disputing consumer law and factual\
disputing the first of its kind and\
listen these credit repair software\
companies are making millions of dollars\
and making you go into their system and\
choose a reason and choose a letter\
they're not telling you that these are\
all bootleg template letters that\
millions of people have been using over\
and over and over again all of these\
softwares are banking on the fact that\
you do not know the difference between\
factual disputing consumer law and\
Metrocompliance attacking and this is\
exactly why credit repair companies get\
away with all of this let's just take a\
second and be honest that consumers\
don't even know that Metro compliance\
even exists they've been convinced that\
all these bootleg template letters work\
and don't try to come into the comments\
and say "Oh this is a sponsored video."\
No it's not because I actually own\
Dispute Beast dispute Beast is the only\
software that's going to create your\
custom flow to your specific issues\
making sure to use consumer law factual\
disputing and metro compliance\
creating custom letters every single\
month dispute is always going to attack\
the big three credit reporting agencies\
Experian Equifax and TransUnion and also\
the creditors but it doesn't just stop\
there because it's also going to attack\
the secondary credit reporting agencies\
that nobody talks about no it doesn't\
freeze them you don't need to freeze\
them you need to attack them and I'm\
referring to Lexus Nexus LCI Anovvice\
ARS Credco Clarity Data X Microbuilt\
Factor Trust all of them because you\
need to eradicate these negative items\
everywhere dispute Beast is literally\
doing everything out there that no other\
credit repair software does and you're\
probably asking yourself how is it\
possible that Dispute Beast is light\
years ahead of an entire credit repair\
industry well it's just simple because\
they just don't care and I'm going to\
repeat it again before anybody else\
comes into the comments and asks "Mike\
should we freeze the secondary credit\
reporting agencies?" No we are not doing\
that because that is from like okay\
we are way more advanced than that and\
you have to attack these negative items\
everywhere and eradicate it everywhere\
this is where every credit repair\
company fails all of these amateurs\
spewing the same bootleg parited\
information no you need to attack them\
directly and eradicate it because even\
if you freeze the secondary credit\
reporting agencies they still have\
access to your credit reports so it's\
pointless because if it's on your credit\
report they have access because again we\
want to attack it and eradicate it\
everywhere and that's the main reason\
why Dispute Beast attacks all the\
secondary credit reporting agencies we\
don't want to freeze them we want to\
attack them dispute Beast truly leaves\
no stone unturned allowing you to\
perform credit repair at the highest\
level possible now let me go ahead and\
show you how truly easy it is to use\
Dispute Beast and before I jump into\
this understand that Dispute Beast is\
the only AI credit repair software that\
comes with a % money back guarantee\
so if it doesn't work we pay you so you\
literally have nothing to lose so let me\
show you exactly how it works\
last part's the most important now once\
you set up your account it's going to\
give you the option of what types of\
utility bills you can upload and your\
driver's license and then you're going\
to click the big blue button and it's\
going to show you all the negative items\
that are hurting your credit now before\
you hit the start attack if you want to\
attack any hard inquiries just scroll\
all the way down to the very bottom and\
then you'll choose the hard inquiries\
that you would like to attack on your\
credit reports you see right there now\
if once you click on it it's going to\
tell you what you can and cannot do and\
how to not make a mistake so you don't\
have to sit there and guess like oh what\
should I do am I doing the right thing\
no it will make sure that you do not\
fail in this process and then once you\
click the little start attack button\
then it's going to start to generate\
your attacks and show you exactly what\
your letters look like as you can see\
it's analyzing items and it usually\
takes about maybe to seconds at\
max i don't think it's ever taken that\
long but once it does that it's going to\
populate your letters so give it a\
second here and it'll pop up right now\
in a second and it's going to create\
those custom letters for every single\
person's different situation of\
whatever's on your credit report\
attacking all of the negative items that\
are hurting your credit and keeping your\
credit score down now you're going to\
have two different choices on how to\
actually proceed once it creates your\
letters as you can see right here here\
we go so you're going to have the option\
to let Sprintmail mail your letters for\
you for whatever the fee is or you can\
print your letters but that's the fee\
for however different many letters you\
have the fees are going to vary based on\
how many letters you actually have to\
send or you can email the attacks to\
yourself and then once you email them\
then you can print them and mail them on\
your own so you control the entire\
process you could choose which either\
one you want to use depending on how\
easy you want this to be for yourself\
but as you can see it created all of the\
major credit reporting agencies and all\
of the secondary credit reporting\
agencies and the creditors it created\
all of your letters in literally just a\
matter of seconds and as you can see you\
could choose to email them to yourself\
or use Sprint Mail so the choice is\
going to be yours but the entire process\
has been completely simplified as you\
saw you didn't have to pick any reasons\
or any letters no Dispute Beast truly\
does all the work for you and remember\
Dispute Beast is the only AI credit\
repair software out here that is going\
to offer you a % money back guarantee\
there's literally nobody else that does\
that because they don't have confidence\
in their product apparently like we do\
because we stand behind it we believe it\
and we know it works it truly doesn't\
get any easier than this ladies and\
gentlemen so if you are ready to get\
started and take control of your credit\

software ever created Dispute Beast now\

Business Credit Strategy So Good It Feels Illegal\
i've been approved for more than \
business credit lines for my company and\
haven't been denied business funding for\
years but this isn't the case for most\
business owners because they apply for\
funding all wrong in this video I want\
to share with you the secret strategies\
experts use to acquire the most business\
funding possible how you can implement\
it yourself and what makes this strategy\
the best to quickly secure business\
credit but first I'm going to explain\
what you need to run this place\
successfully for your business when I\
first started my entrepreneurship\
journey my credit was low s and I\
literally had to build my credit from\
the ground up that means credit repair\
building banking relationships and\
paying off my debt to lower my\
utilization rate over time but with this\
method I'm going to share today you can\
skip the years it took me to build six\
figures of business funding and get\
there in as little as a month however if\
The Recipe For Success\
you want to skip the grind you got to\
come correct that means you need a solid\
personal credit profile no negatives on\
your report and preferably a personal\
credit card with at least a K limit\
here's the secret business credit\
lenders typically give you to five\
times more your personal limit when you\
apply for business funding just do the\
math with a K personal credit card\
limit you can expect between to K\
in business credit card approvals so\
yeah you can skip the line if the banks\
trust you from the RIP and this means\
showing them you know what to do with\
the bag once they give it to you now\
that you know what you need to run the\
Avoid This Mistake\
play the question is what exact strategy\
gets you the most amount of business\
funding within the shortest time the old\
way to get business credit requires you\
to go to different lenders randomly\
apply to their funding products and hope\
that you get enough to invest back into\
your business that strategy is outdated\
and here's why every time you apply for\
funding you get a hard inquiry on your\
credit profile and this is how that\
actually hurts your chances at getting\
approved every inquir you get lowers\
your credit score between to five\
points too many recent inquiries and\
your funding applications will start to\
automatically get flagged and lastly\
randomly applying to multiple lenders\
can take months if not years to get the\
funding that you actually need so how do\
The Secret Sauce\
you avoid these mistakes and get\
business credit quickly without setting\
off alarms the answer is bank stacking\
instead of going to random lenders over\
time bank stacking is when you\
strategically apply to multiple banks\
within a short time window based on what\
specific credit bureaus they pull from\
when done correctly this limits the\
amount of total inquiries you get\
overall and it allows you to get\
approved for multiple business credit\
products from different lenders before\
too many inquiries hit your credit\
report when applying for funding banks\
typically pull your credit from a\
specific bureau if you know what bureau\
each lender pulls from specifically you\
can apply for multiple business credit\
products at the same time that each pull\
from a different credit bureau now\
instead of getting three different\
inquiries from each different credit\
bureau you'll only get one per bureau\
and lenders won't get tipped off about\
your other applications this ultimately\
limits the likelihood that you raise\
suspicion and cause red flags as you\
secure more funding that's the real\
sauce with getting a big bag when it\
comes to business credit applying a bank\
stacking method is like going to a\
buffet you don't just get one piece of\
food sit down and then go back when\
you're done you load up your plate with\
as much as you can at once before all\
the good stuff runs out this same theory\
applies to funding with bank stacking\
apply to all the best lenders as quickly\
as possible before your credit report\
gets cold because of too many inquiries\
and now that we're all hungry and ready\
to stack your plate with business credit\
I'm going to show you exactly how you\
How To Execute The Strategy\
can execute a bank stacking sequence so\
you can get up to K in business\
funding fast first you need to identify\
which lenders pull from which bureau so\
you don't overlap your hard inquiries\
during the application process you can\
do this by searching creditor databases\
like creditboard.com or my FICO forums\
these databases allow you to search\
lenders by geographic location and get\
information on which credit bureaus\
they're pulling from but here's a secret\
that'll get you even more funding during\
this process before you search for banks\
that do hard credit pools first apply to\
multiple lenders who do soft pools and\
won't leave inquiries on your credit\
these companies can include Divvy\
Revenue Brets and even Amex if you're\
already a member with a card they won't\
do a hard pool anytime you apply for a\
new business credit product using soft\
pools allows you to rack up a few\
approvals and build trade lines on your\
business profile with no personal credit\
risk and these approvals will also\
benefit you when you start to go to more\
traditional lenders you'll be able to\
show prior credit history for your\
business and they may base your approval\
amounts on what you already have now\
that we've covered how to plan out the\
first part of your banking stacking\
sequence let's take a look at how to\
plan out your hard inquiry strategy\
we'll use creditboards.com to search for\
specific lenders and the credit bureaus\
that they pull from you can also call\
the bank or lender directly in most\
cases and ask what bureau they pull from\
as well here we have the credit boards\
website you can access this at\
credits.com as I stated this is just a\
great resource for you to go ahead and\
check on specific lenders and banks and\
see exactly where they pull from as far\
as the credit bureau if you don't\
already have that information at hand\
and one of the great things that I\
really like about this website is that\
you can actually go down and search the\
credit pools database not only for even\
the name of the bank but your geographic\
location so as you probably know not all\
banks and lenders are national and serve\
every state so you can go ahead and put\
your state into this category right here\
i'm going to just start out on my\
location i'm on the east coast in\
Pennsylvania so just go ahead and select\
PA and then at CRA that is credit\
reporting agency based on what credit\
bureau you want to search you can go\
ahead and select that right here equifax\
TransUnion or Experian now a little\
extra sauce I want to give you is make\
sure you focus on the less used credit\
bureaus first so in my recommendation\
that's going to be first TransUnion then\
Equifax and Experian with Experian being\
the most used credit bureau for most\
lenders for my credit boards I'm going\
to go ahead and search TransUnion first\
so I can go ahead and just put that\
under CRA you can put date applied but I\
usually just keep that open and you can\
actually choose if your results are from\
people who've got approved or no so just\
a lot of filters here to where you can\
get the best data possible you go ahead\
and press update here and you can see\
not only the state the zip code the\
reporting agency the date people apply\
if they got approved the score they had\
the limit they got and a few comments as\
far as some things to know so just a lot\
of good information here i'm just taking\
a look at maybe some familiar banks or\
some that I would want to apply to as it\
relates to TransUnion so here I see TD\
Bank and I know TD Bank is going to be a\
larger bank and not only one that's in\
my location but one that I know I can do\
online as well here I'm just going to go\
ahead and write down TD Bank in just a\
short Google doc and I'm going to note\
TD Bank that they're pulling from\
TransUnion so I literally have my first\
bank here in my funding bank stacking\
sequence starting with TransUnion and\
it's always good that you can go ahead\
and get maybe one or two more as well\
and as I'm going through the next page\
one that I'm seeing a lot as well in the\
PA area is going to be members first so\
we got our approval for members first\
here at uh for\
$just going through some other\
ones i see another members first\
approval here $another good thing\
you can do is as you see these banks\
that are in my credit boards you can\
literally just look up on Google to make\
sure that you can actually apply for\
them for the business credit cards or\
business products but you also want to\
just check if you can do them online and\
as you can see at the very top it is\
already telling you right off the rip\
that Members First Credit Union does\
allow you to apply for certain business\
credit cards online now keep in mind you\
might not have to search my credit\
boards for every single bureau i already\
know in my location there are a few\
great lenders that already pull Equifax\
and for me that's going to be Truis and\
Key Bank so I don't necessarily have to\
search my credit boards for that i can\
already just jot that down so we just\
want to go ahead and put KeyBank that's\
going to be from Equifax as well as\
Truest all we need to do now is get our\
last credit bureau which is going to be\
Experian and I do already have a go-to\
for my Experian which is going to be\
Chase that's always going to be number\
one when it comes to the first bank I\
want to go to with the Experian credit\
bureau it doesn't hurt to get a few more\
lenders as well same routine i just put\
in my state PA i'm going to go ahead and\
change the credit reporting agency to\
Experian and just update that filter off\
the rip I'm already getting some good\
banks that I would probably take a look\
at uh first one being Bank of America\
once again that is a bank with branches\
near me but I can also look that up and\
verify that they allow you to apply for\
business products online as you can see\
Bank of America apply approved their\
score $right under it another\
Bank of America approved almost $\
there the more that you see these banks\
that you are familiar with that are\
coming up repeatedly those would be good\
ones to add to your bank stack and\
funding sequence the first one we want\
to definitely do when it comes to\
Experian is always going to be Chase now\
we also have Bank of America for a\
secondary now I did mention AX in our\
soft pool category but if you don't\
already have a AX and art in their\
system you can also apply for Amex but\
it is going to be a hard pool and most\
of the time Amex business products are\
also going to pull from Experian as well\
so I'll just go ahead and put Amex here\
just using the knowledge that we have as\
well as a database like my credit board\
we already have two four seven banks\
from just three credit bureaus for our\
TransUnion Bank stacking sequence we're\
going to have TD Bank and Members First\
Credit Union so we highlight those here\
for our Equifax credit bureau we're\
going to have Key Bank and Truis and\
then we have our Experian credit bureau\
when it comes to the bank stacking\
sequence which we have three lenders and\
that's going to be Chase Bank of America\
and AAX so it doesn't have to be that\
hard to put together a bank stack and\
funding sequence you just have to do a\
little bit of research and due diligence\
and then put this into place now that we\
have the lenders that we want to go to\
with each specific bureau let's get back\
to how exactly to implement this play\
even further to maximize your bank\
EXTRA Sauce!\
stacking sequence you want to make sure\
you apply to at least one lender that\
pulls from each bureau and here's some\
additional sauce that you want to\
remember while running this play try to\
do all of your applications within a\
-hour window so that all the inquiries\
state the same day but different bureaus\
use incognito mode on your web browser\
to prevent websites from sharing cookies\
and tracking your activities from\
previous applications lastly make sure\
you're applying to banks that\
predominantly go off stated and\
projected income to determine your\
approvals and limits this avoids having\
to provide additional financial\
documentation as you apply for business\
credit if done correctly executing a\
funding sequence like this could easily\
get you over a K in business funding\
here's a quick breakdown you could in\
theory get at least K in approvals\
just from the soft pool lenders alone\
then if you average K in approvals\
from just one lender from each bureau\
that's a $in funding for your\
business in just hours and the best\
part is because all your inquiries came\
on separate credit bureaus on the same\
day you limited your total amount of\
inquiries from nine across all credit\
bureaus to just three this strategy will\
keep your credit profile as clean and\
strong as possible therefore when you go\
to do another bank stacking sequence it\
won't trigger a bunch of flags with\
potential lenders when they go to go\
check your personal credit again now\
listen because this next point is\
Get Even MORE Funding\
crucial just because you stacked your\
plate with funding doesn't mean you\
should disappear after you secure the\
bag think about it do you have a\
favorite restaurant or store that you go\
in and immediately they recognize you\
and start showing love just because\
you're a loyal customer that's exactly\
how you want your banks to treat you as\
well but to become a loyal customer for\
a business credit lender you can't just\
take the money they give you and ghost\
them you need to build a relationship\
and show them that you're there for the\
long run i didn't get to six figures in\
funding all at once by just going to\
apply to a bunch of different banks when\
I first got approved for business credit\
I saw that I was still leaving money on\
the table i realized I can get a lot\
more benefits if I stopped worrying\
about the next lender and focused on\
building with the ones that had already\
funded me they were willing to give me\
more if I just stayed in touch and\
showed that I had good habits the truth\
is banks aren't just giving away money\
based on your credit score anymore it's\
also about trust and you begin to build\
this trust before but definitely after\
you're already in their ecosystem and\
here's how you play the trust game after\
you get approved for funding with one\
bank don't just use the card\
occasionally do at least to plus\
transactions on it monthly and pay off\
your balance immediately then reach out\
to your business relationship manager\
and ask for a credit limit increase\
every days this shows your business\
is active and able to handle the bag\
that they gave you even if you only got\
approved for a K initially this could\
get you a to K limit in as little\
as months if played right oh and\
because you're already in your system\
this can be done without more hard pools\
and inquiries on your credit report some\
lenders will pre-qualify you for\
additional business credit products like\
lines of credit and business credit\
cards purely based on your activity and\
payment history but you have to build a\
relationship with them and ask or you'll\
never know so once you get approved for\
Keep Stacking..\
funding using the stacking method here's\
a few things to do do at least to \
transactions a month and pay off your\
balance consistently set calendar\
reminders every days to reach out to\
your lender and inquire about limit\
increases and additional internal\
funding products lastly continue to grow\
your business using their credit so that\
in the future you can provide financial\
documentation and show them that you're\
actually putting what they gave you to\
proper use the goal is to show them that\
you're not just a one-time applicant\
searching for money you're a real\
business you're playing the long game\
and you're here to build a real\
partnership stacking gets your foot in\
the door but the relationship unlocks\
the real bag and that's the part most\
people miss but if you're still unsure\
which banks to hit first how to properly\
structure your business for maximum\
funding or how to make these lenders\
compete to fund you that's exactly what\
I'll teach you inside my funding formula\
this is the exact step-by-step blueprint\
that has helped entrepreneurs secure\
thousands in funding even with no\
experience and brand new businesses if\
you're serious about running a business\
credit play the right way hit the link\
in the description and let's secure this\
bag together however if you just want\
more sauce on how to properly prepare\
yourself and your business for funding\
along your own journey\
Banks Love To See This If You Want Business Credit!\
The Struggle\
are you a business owner with a decent\
credit score and an established business\
but still struggling to get approved for\
business credit i've been there before\
myself and used to repeatedly get denied\
for business funding until I learned\
this crucial concept in this video I'm\
going to show you why you're still\
getting denied business credit what\
lenders are actually looking at when\
you're submitting an application and the\
proven strategy that I've used to turn\
denials into business credit approvals\
and rack up hundreds of thousands in\
Getting Started..\
funding but first I want to take you\
back to when I started my\
entrepreneurial journey i had grown a\
business that was making money and I was\
ready to scale it to the next level but\
I needed more capital to make that\
happen so I started applying for\
business credit unsurprisingly I just\
ran into denial after denial and I found\
myself blaming banks and lenders for\
what was happening to me but once I\
figured this out everything changed and\
I started getting five figure approvals\
to grow my business stay to the end of\
this video cuz I'm going to show you\
exactly how I did it most entrepreneurs\
You Got It All Wrong\
think they can just skip right to\
business credit once they have a LLC\
established with a business bank account\
and don't let me get started on that s\
but this couldn't be further from the\
truth here's what banks aren't telling\
you they rely on multiple factors to\
determine if they're going to improve\
your business for funding or not even if\
you have a decent business a proper\
structure and open other accounts with\
them they will still deny you business\
credit the reason is if you want to bag\
from lenders they have to trust you if\
you're new to business credit as a small\
business the biggest factor that lenders\
will rely on is your personal credit and\
not just your score alone it's about\
having a fully optimized profile that\
shows you're lendable even a strong\
business on paper means nothing if the\
banks think you're not trustworthy as\
the business owner i had a student who\
The Biggest Mistake\
needed business funding to purchase more\
vehicles for their tour business and\
then wanted to leverage that into real\
estate they came to me with a credit\
score in the s a business entity that\
was decently structured with money in\
the bank you would think that this was\
the ideal candidate for banks to offer\
business credit to right that's the\
first mistake most business owners fall\
into he blindly submitted business\
credit applications but received\
constant denials based on this one\
factor a thin personal credit profile\
your personal credit is like the\
co-signer of your business didn't know\
it needed it's like when you try to go\
get an apartment for the very first time\
even though you have the money to pay\
for the apartment and are ready to get\
it on your own the landlord still asks\
you for a co-signer to be approved and\
move in this is because you're still\
relatively new on your journey and\
haven't shown the history that you can\
be trusted to pay your own debts so they\
ask for a co-signer just in case at some\
point you wind up not being able to hold\
up your end of the bargain this is the\
same thing banks and lenders do to small\
businesses who haven't yet established a\
credit history of their own now that you\
understand why your personal credit is\
crucial to your business success let's\
get into how to make sure you never get\
denied by lenders again i get it Bag\
They Can\'92t Deny This!\
Chasers hearing that your personal\
credit still matters when it comes to\
your business might stink a little bit\
especially when you've put so much\
effort into getting your business off\
the ground in the first place but the\
thing is knowing how to properly\
structure your credit report is key\
it'll turn constant denials into\
unlimited funding that'll take your\
business to new heights having a good\
credit score without a strong profile is\
comparable to the guy who shows up to\
the games and all the best gear but\
isn't actually that good i've been\
practicing\
this for this yeah you look great on the\
outside but when we take a closer look\
at your game we can tell that you don't\
have what it takes to perform when those\
lights come on yeah don't be that person\
let's get your game right and go through\
a framework which I call the lender lens\
Lender Lens\
this strategy focuses on the five key\
areas lenders are silently looking at to\
approve you for business credit if\
you're maxing out all your available\
credit and only paying back the minimum\
requirements well lenders will assume\
that you're going to do the same thing\
with business credit the first thing\
lenders will check is how you're\
handling your current credit balances\
and debt this is called high utilization\
and it's a huge risk that lenders will\
avoid at all costs you want to target\
your overall utilization at somewhere\
between to % under % is even\
better this shows that you don't have to\
use every dollar given to you to sustain\
your lifestyle and that you can manage\
your finances efficiently if a bank\
pulls your credit profile and you have\
even one maxed out card this can look\
like you're overextending your debt and\
lead to a denial the next thing lenders\
will check is how seasoned your profile\
is and no I'm not talking about adding a\
dash of salt to your credit your credit\
history and its age show how long you've\
been actively using your credit and\
lending accounts this lets lenders know\
that you're not new to the credit game\
and that they can trust you based on\
your track record of previous accounts\
the goal here is to five plus years of\
credit history the older the better a\
credit profile with less than years of\
history can mean more risk for a lender\
to take on and the greater the risk the\
greater the chances you are of being\
denied for business funding but your\
utilization rate and credit age aren't\
the only things that lenders will want\
to see if you want those high limit\
approvals for your business they also\
want to know that you pay back your debt\
on time this is called your payment\
history there's no way around it you\
must have % on-time payments if you\
want business credit anything below that\
is an instant red flag and will get your\
application denied banks and lenders\
have internal ranking systems that we\
don't see and even just one -day late\
payment can drop your internal score \
to points i advise all my students\
to turn on the autopay feature for all\
their credit cards and lines of credit\
to ensure that they at least make the\
minimum payment and avoid the risk of\
getting a late payment on their credit\
this is a no-brainer especially as you\
start to add more credit cards to your\
arsenal now you got to understand all\
debt is not created equal most business\
owners overlook this but it's one of the\
biggest cheat codes in getting business\
credit approvals the fourth things\
lenders judge your approval on is what\
type of accounts that you have on your\
profile credit cards traditional loans\
student loans store cards auto loans\
they all hold different weight when it\
comes to strengthening your credit\
profile this is called your credit mix\
there are normally three categories that\
this breaks down to the first is\
revolving accounts these are open credit\
lines that have flexible repayment terms\
this means credit cards and lines of\
credit and keep it in mind that bank\
cards do hold more weight than store\
branded cards then you have installment\
accounts these are loans that come with\
fixed payments that means auto loans\
student loans and credit builder loans\
then lastly you have what I call\
specialty accounts and these are\
mortgages and helocks having a mix of\
multiple of these types of accounts\
shows that you're financially\
well-rounded and that you can handle\
different types of debt the optimal goal\
here is to have at least three to five\
revolving accounts and these are primary\
accounts that are in your name because\
lenders can tell if you're just an\
authorized user that has been put on\
someone else's card then you want to\
have at least one to two installment\
accounts and having a mortgage or almost\
paid off auto loan can really help here\
a strong credit mix gives you a strong\
chance that lenders will trust you with\
a business credit bag when you apply but\
no matter how high your score is or how\
long your mix of credit history goes\
back there's still one thing that can\
absolutely kill your chances at getting\
approved for business credit these red\
flags are deal breakers for lenders and\
even if the rest of your credit report\
is spotless missing this is like having\
a big juice stain in the middle of a\
fresh clean white shirt when I first\
started trying to obtain business credit\
this was my biggest obstacle also I had\
a good credit score i built\
relationships with banks and had a good\
mix of credit on my profile i also had a\
Verizon bill that got put into\
collections every time I applied for\
business credit I got denied and when I\
asked why I was always told I had too\
many derogatory accounts on my report\
the crazy thing is it was only one so I\
really had to put the time in to repair\
my credit and make sure I got that\
derogatory account removed it wasn't\
easy but I stayed patient and I got it\
done not only did this removal increase\
my score by over points but it also\
opened the door for me to start getting\
consistent approvals from lenders and\
this is what taught me the power of\
having a clean and structured personal\
credit profile i'm talking about\
derogatory accounts derogatories include\
accounts that have been sent to\
collections charge offs tax leans and\
definitely bankruptcies accounts get to\
this status when you haven't paid the\
creditor in so long they decide to close\
your account and sell it off to a debt\
collector this will kill your chances at\
funding faster than anything else this\
shows lenders you have a history of not\
paying back your debts and you might run\
off with the bag if they decide to give\
it to you that's the biggest risk that\
banks want to avoid derogatory accounts\
are instant denials now although those\
derogatory accounts are suicide having\
excessive inquiries can also kill your\
chances at business credit more than two\
to three inquiries on your credit\
profile show as lenders that you've just\
been out there asking a bunch of people\
for money and the irony is banks only\
want to give money to people that they\
think don't need it you have to change\
the way you look at your profile and\
start looking at it through the lender's\
lens this will help you turn those\
constant denials into consistent\
approvals when you go for business\
credit now let's be real the lender lens\
Stack The Bag\
is just the minimum requirement you need\
to get into the game the goal here isn't\
to barely qualify for business credit\
it's to be so prepared before submitting\
an application that lenders and banks\
actually compete to give your business\
funding this takes you from hoping you\
get approved to being able to pick and\
choose what lenders you get credit from\
kind of like a kid in the candy store\
this is the next level positioning\
yourself to be a business that lenders\
want to do business with and give the\
bag to this is what separates you from\
the pack i call it the fundability stack\
this is a method that you layer on top\
of the lender lens so that you can\
create a for sure six-f figureure\
fundable credit profile once you limit\
your risk downside this is what\
increases your approval amounts to the\
maximum lenders don't just pull your\
profile from the three major credit\
bureaus they also gather information\
from secondary bureaus like Lexus Nexus\
Sage Stream Innovs\
if all your information doesn't match on\
these as well it looks fishy to lenders\
but you can fix this easily here's how\
make sure you update all of your\
personal information on these secondary\
credit bureaus before you apply for any\
funding that means name address phone\
number even your birthday all of this\
information must match on the primary\
credit bureaus but the secondary ones as\
well and most of these can be updated\
directly on the website but some of them\
you will have to mail in to update the\
info this should be an easy fix if you\
want six figures of funding for your\
business and we already know that\
lenders are big on credit age and mix\
this next stacking method is about\
adding depth to your profile to make it\
as strong as possible but how do you do\
that well you want to make sure you have\
as many primary accounts with as much\
age as possible the question is what do\
you do if you don't already have the\
credit cards in your name that give you\
the boost that you need this is where\
age primary trade lines come into play\
remember banks and lenders can tell if\
you just been added as an authorized\
user on someone else's accounts they\
don't hold nearly the same weight as you\
have in a primary so if you don't have\
three to five primary accounts reporting\
on your profile already you can add them\
by using companies like Self and Credit\
Strong loan programs secured credit\
cards from institutions like Navy Fed\
Capital and Discover plus you can use\
a tool like rent reporters which allows\
you to report your rent and backdated a\
few years on your profile to ensure that\
you get a little bit more of a primary\
with age on it having primary accounts\
like these on your credit profile adds\
an extra layer of depth that lenders\
want to see to be able to trust you and\
fund your business and now that all the\
information on your profile matches and\
you have the primaries that lenders want\
to see there's one more element to the\
fundability stack to make sure that your\
business gets the approvals that it\
needs we know that utilization is a key\
data point for lenders but did you know\
that you can still raise a red flag even\
if you're at the to % goal if you\
have one card that is holding most of\
your debt and is close to its credit\
limit it can still be seen as a sign of\
risk for lenders and that's because they\
look at your individual account usage as\
well not just your overall utilization\
here's how to fix this before banks deny\
you for being overleveraged and this\
isn't hard to do if you have multiple\
credit cards at your disposal instead of\
holding all your debt on just one card\
spread out your credit balances as\
evenly as possible across multiple\
credit cards and lines and if you do\
have to put a little bit more on one\
card make sure it's the one with the\
lowest interest rate and then focus on\
paying back the cards with the higher\
interest rates first this balances out\
your debt exposure and shows lenders\
that you can manage multiple cards\
effectively now it's time to bring\
The Big Picture\
everything we learned full circle first\
we broke down the lender lens method the\
five key elements of your personal\
profile that lenders look at when you\
submit a business credit application if\
just one of them is out of alignment it\
could be the reason that you're getting\
denied funding even with a good credit\
score then we covered the fundability\
stack three underlying strategies that\
take you from acceptable to undeniable\
this is what makes banks compete to fund\
you instead of you chasing them but the\
only remaining question is now that your\
profile is fully optimized to get\
approved for business credit how and\
where do you go to get the most funding\
in the shortest amount of time\
How to properly "Discharge & Offset Debts" in the U.S.: Steps including the use Promissory Notes!!!\
discharging what is that discharging is\
the fact that\
by law we don't have money money implies\
that\
there is gold silver copper jewels\
you know something\
based or backed behind it to give it its\
value\
paper especially federal reserve notes\
are\
printed\
to be\
promises to pay in the future\
so\
what is that a promise to pay in the\
futures is credit\
they say this is good\
even though it's a piece of paper\
and at the bank or like the knights\
templar\
you can take it to a castle or whatever\
else which is where the first banking\
really came from and that you can redeem\
it for lawful money lawful money is\
different than\
the legal tender that we are using okay\
all that can really be considered\
currency\
so\
one of the ways that people have and\
we've already talked about this video\
um i might put the\
educational information back up on my\
site because people have been asking me\
for my version of the promissory notes\
uh once again we don't i don't make any\
guarantees that it's going to work for\
you because some of the banks are shady\
and depending on how you use them the\
people that you're sending them to may\
not know how to process the information\
so that is contained\
in the areas where we've been successful\
with them in that package\
we've been selling it bucks privately\
so that might be\
back on the website at some point in\
time\
otherwise i did show you guys videos on\
how to find them and make your own\
now with the promissory note you have to\
understand that\
only the banks really know how to\
monetize or securitize those things they\
already do it with your house note okay\
which is where the fraud comes in\
because they didn't tell you that they\
were going to do that\
um and then all the other fraud that\
goes on along behind there so look up uh\
what is it uh regulation z in the uh\
mortgage lending okay i also taught you\
guys how to look up your banks to see if\
all the other cases they've lost in\
federal or supreme court about the fraud\
they've done\
consult me for a little more information\
on that\
um\
otherwise in general yes promissory\
notes typically will work for banks\
loans things of that nature\
other entities it's harder to do with\
them with them because you'd have to\
make it payable to them and then\
give them the information that they need\
to then send it to their bank but a\
higher up to then process it and then\
it's still going to take days for\
them to monetize it i know this because\
smells wargo vp called me and said they\
were going to monetize mine and then\
when the time came they reneged on the\
offer fraud extended kept the note\
that is a violation of law okay and\
theft and deception and all that other\
good stuff all right but anyway so\
um have we been successful yes of all\
mine especially from back in the day\
have been done and have been successful\
and a large number of them i probably\
say to people\
percent of people um have used them and\
they've been successful but only when\
dealing with direct bank related things\
now obviously because we're sharing\
their dirty little secret um some have\
decided to not be honorable because they\
weren't honorable in the first place\
um but like i said we've made videos on\
that so that is still an option but\
obviously we can't make any guarantees\
because each individual institution\
decides what what they want to do\
and what not okay\
so one of the next options you can use\
for discharging your debts would be the\
c\
um\
Cancellation\
the c stands for cancellation that means\
that\
i have provided you with credit\
okay\
nine times out of ten you it was your\
signature your signature and your social\
that provided them the credit for what\
they did\
um\
banks are forbidden from loaning money\
and assets okay\
especially lawful money they're not\
going to give you anything that's\
actually worth gold they're going to\
give you\
credit where did that credit come from\
nine times out of ten it came from the\
promissory note that you signed they\
used your social security number to\
access certain accounts okay educational\
information only from favorite\
non-believers not combatant treaties\
united states and private citizen\
um so in you providing them with credit\
uh they then gave it back to you and\
then now you're actually paying for the\
service that they provided\
all right so in sending whoever it is\
your creditor at c\
this is this the c stands for\
cancellation so you're telling me i've\
paid you\
i want any recoupment that i'm um\
entitled to and then i want to cancel\
the contract between us\
now\
i personally have not done this this\
will be a potential next step\
and by that i mean for a house because\
if you're still paying on a house and\
you send them a c\
they\
i've just i've just personally never\
done that particular aspect of it other\
people i know have done it for other\
things with c and were successful\
i've personally never done it with my\
own house\
most reasons why is because i haven't\
found anybody who's done it also with\
their house because if you're cancelling\
the agreement\
they're probably going to try to go\
after you and\
uh even though they committed fraud and\
even though you are the provider of the\
credit i just have never done that i\
don't want to i don't mind rocking the\
boat but i don't like to rock the boat\
with where i live when\
that scenario now of course yes we do\
have the ability to\
stay up in court and actually would kind\
of be a blessing in disguise because\
then we could present the other\
information by forcing them to force us\
to go to court because then we can use\
all of the information that's held in\
the higher courts but\
they might try to take you to the lower\
courts where they're all buddy buddy\
with the fake magic the real match rates\
fake judges and whatever else so we want\
them where court cases matter so that\
would be in the federal district court\
so that's where you'd want to take them\
okay which by the way smells\
got a little something coming for you\
but anyway let's move on so one of the\
IRS Offset\
next options people can do to discharge\
debts is an irs\
offset is what what it's called you can\
inform your creditor that you want to\
you authorize them to do in\
an offset through the irs sometimes it's\
called a mutual offset\
now when you offset through the irs\
um keep in mind that they may\
just they'll take that person's offset\
authorization for to wipe that debt for\
you but it doesn't just go away because\
it's going to then appear on your\
taxes at the end of the year okay so you\
discharge your house through irs offset\
you discharge your dental bills or\
whatever else which we made a video on\
that\
um it's going to just transfer on over\
now if you do that\
educational information only you can set\
up a consultation with me and we can\
deal with how to handle the irs issue at\
the end of the year but only done in\
private and that's educational\
information yes it has been successful\
um but we like to not put on all the\
information out there\
um it's just how it is okay or you can\
just deal with it yourself you know\
there's other ways you can talk to your\
uh lawyer or your attorney lawyer tax\
guy whoever else and\
you know make things happen to offset\
once again some things just leave it at\
that\
all right\
so one of the last ones that's been used\
since time and time again a lot of you\
guys didn't know this um\
i'm actually in the process of doing\
this right now with the\
abode we shall say\
um domiciled into private\
is\
hjr\
or public law -\
now\
HJR \
it depending on your level of reading\
and understanding this information um\
understand that this is um\
trying to give you the short version of\
it\
it's a\
your right to authorize the discharge of\
a debt through the treasury\
because under hjr public laws -\
it states that all public u.s\
obligations or debts\
are then obligations of the u.s treasury\
payable by the secretary of treasury\
okay\
so\
there's a lot of\
words and there's a lot of information\
when if you read the full article um\
but essentially\
once we got off the gold standard we\
were put into a position where we they\
took our gold and that gold is still\
accumulating interest so\
that sitting there the determination\
between in congress and in the house\
joint and all that was that um\
all of our debts are supposed to be\
prepaid\
okay but all of our\
straw man nondagor war name\
in latin\
um\
\
your legal name that legal entity so all\
of those debts by your name and all\
uppercase lettering\
and to some degree i guess you could\
kind of slosh in upper and lower case\
um because those are all your public\
transmitting utilities these are\
your name that was transmuted into their\
property okay as a federalized state\
employee\
so by having that there's one reason why\
i tell people not to necessarily\
renounce or because you're throwing away\
some benefits and privileges that you\
might want to use\
so\
um\
okay so with that being said the those\
are those public entities okay the debts\
that\
you have acquired as a\
surety or an authorized agent who should\
assume no financial or physical\
liability for\
have\
when you purchase your stuff you\
transmit it you transmit it into your\
that trust that business trust that they\
set up for you okay now it is considered\
to be their debt so yes your house your\
car your phone all stuff that you bought\
with your name and all capitalized\
letters or a combination thereof\
essentially moved into that business\
trust so that it owns it you don't own\
it\
you don't own it until you transfer that\
stuff out into the\
private trust that you create without\
using your same exact name\
okay give it a different name otherwise\
you're transferring it out and then\
right back into the same\
business trust that you want to get away\
from it from in the first place excuse\
me allergies\
um\
Public Law \
so when you look up that resolution\
especially public law -and there's\
another one that goes by i don't\
remember that one\
um you can authorize your creditors to\
by sending them a letter stating that\
information that you want to you're\
authorizing them to discharge it through\
that now educational information only\
you can send that directly to\
the company but you want to make sure\
that it goes to\
the higher ups okay at least the cfo\
anybody else is probably not going to\
understand that information or you can\
send it directly to the treasury\
attention to the secretary of the\
treasury\
and from there\
it might take some time but you should\
hear back from them and by time i do\
mean\
it will probably take you nine months to\
a year maybe even a year\
and a half\
okay i'm still waiting to hear back on\
something that i'm\
discharging\
and so it's gonna take time\
all right so back in the day a lot of\
people i older gurus if you will\
once again i'm definitely not a guru um\
told me that when they did it that it\
used to be quick\
and painless and now it's a little bit\
more arduous which is why a lot of\
people including myself kind of stop\
doing those little processes and just\
you know either discharge this way or\
just pay it whatever your your call your\
choice your information all right\
Conclusion\
so\
that is pretty much it guys those are\
all the top ways um i know some people\
had inquired about the boe\
so the boe is just a bill of exchange\
it's underneath the term negotiable\
instrument already made videos on this\
and but the boes are for purchasing okay\
i will tell you honestly i have not used\
a boe to actually purchase anything\
um why\
because when i discharged all my other\
stuff i was just happy i was like i'm\
good\
it's legal nobody came bothering me it\
was accepted hell i even got accredited\
at one place so i was like i'm good i'm\
done\
that doesn't mean that you can't\
research it it doesn't mean that i won't\
research it in the future but you know\
do your due diligence and as always guys\
before you do somebody's\
process make sure that you at least\
contact these agencies to make sure that\
they understand what's going on what\
you're doing and don't get me wrong\
i know what some of you guys are going\
to say especially about the bonds\
um\
remember the low-level people who are\
going to be answering the phone don't\
know what's going on so i tell people\
don't even bother go and see what you\
have on the account and call today don't\
bother me with it because i'm not going\
to give you any information if you\
bother them with it they're going to\
tell you we know what you're talking\
about it's all internet\
you know crap and whatever else but yet\
the accounts pull up\
so do you really think that they're\
going to tell you over the phone\
something that they consider to be\
private or trust or secret information\
no\
all right so i gave you all the\
information guys you need to to check it\
out other than that i wash my hands\
clean of it\
um\
as a matter of fact keep this in mind a\
lot of you guys aren't even in the right\
position because you have to understand\
that you're going after the very strong\
man that you say you're not\
you're going after the credit and stuff\
within that\
and some of you guys haven't even taken\
control of your strong man you haven't\
confirmed or\
acknowledged your age of a majority\
none of these things\
i'm just going to say so there are more\
steps to trying to do certain some of\
these things successfully so i'm going\
to give and say\
um i don't recommend even going after\
them in the first place like i said edu\
only\
that's it\
um\
so if somebody else knows of any other\
discharge methods out there that i did\
not mention that you have used and that\
are vetted meaning you've done them you\
know you're more than welcome to show me\
send me some proof\
and we'll go from there and then maybe\
i'll make a video on it or you know i'll\
swap uh information with you in exchange\
for that in that confidential piece of\
beautifulness\
so that's it guys i want to thank you\
for watching the bad wolf channel all\
right um i got some more videos coming\
up i got some lives coming up got some\
more files we're going to update\
blacksidewith i'm gonna make some\
files that um are\
need to be free free and we're gonna\
charge for some new ones that's how it\
works so\
that's it don't forget to hit that bell\
like subscribe i definitely appreciate\
each and every one of you guys um we're\
at like i said \
or something like that or \
something like that um like i said next\
goal is and i'm just truly\
amazed and blessed by each and every one\
of you guys if you guys see anybody\
using any of my information likeness\
symbols logos information in a negative\
way\
report them with that button over there\
or down there for bullying slander\

From Banks Denial to Grant Approval: The Secret Hack Nobody Shares!\
credit doesn't play a role in getting approved for a grant Correct because if a person let's say apply for a\
traditional loan they may get denied because of their credit but if they get everything in place for their business\
or for their nonprofit then there's a chance that they can just get approved for the grant Correct Regardless of their credit\
That's correct So grants are not loans and they're not based on personal credit They're they're based on\
Hey what's going on guys calvin Russell here Super excited to bring you all yet another guest speaker All right So\
listen This young man has been helping a lot of people get government grants okay\
for their nonforprofits as well as their businesses Okay So uh listen a lot of\
people have been trying to figure out how can they do this Well listen get your notepads out He does not have a lot\
Introducing Dr Marlon Hayward\
of time but listen he will be able to stick around and answer a few questions for our Club elite Uh of course\
that'll be after this interview But listen let's go and get right into it I most definitely want to take as much time as we can okay with him But let's\
go and introduce you all to Mr uh Dr Marlon Hayward Dr Can you hear us okay Mr Hayward Yep I can hear you All right\
Can Can you hear me absolutely We sure can man How's your day going so far you know what it's great It's the weather is\
is great So anytime it's nice it's sunny outside is always a good day for me\
There we go man Finally Especially in Chicago man We don't get good weather often So we better squeeze these three\
months as much as we [Laughter] can All right Awesome Awesome Well listen Dr Haywood first off I want to\
say thank you for uh making some time you know out of your schedule to go ahead and just give us uh the game on\
how we can go ahead and start qualifying for you know some of these grants and different programs that are available\
Starting a nonprofit\
But a lot of people just don't know you know how to get approved for them and what they're looking for But you've been\
able to get over eight figures you know in grants and such Let's go and take it\
a step back Okay What made you like even start your own nonforprofit and then\
essentially say "Okay you know what i think I'm going to need some funding here." Um well you know what originally\
when I started I started it because I just wanted to make a difference right i didn't know anything about starting a\
nonprofit I didn't know anything about grant writing Um for me I just looked at\
the need and I said "How can I meet the need?" Um I used to go to a local elementary school high school when I was\
in college at niu with the center for black studies And that was something\
that again I just looked at it as it was a passion something I cared about and how can I make a difference it was when\
I graduated from college and I started working at Malcolm X College that I had a friend shout out to Ladies of Virtue\
uh Jamila Trimu who said "Hey I I have a an law firm that's looking to help\
individuals start up their nonprofit pro bono Uh do you have an interest?" And I'm like "Absolutely." So that is\
literally how I got started um in turning Urban Mail Network into a nonprofit because a friend our sister\
organization Ladies of Virtue looked out and said "Here's an opportunity to establish your organization as a c"\
Wow Wow Yeah Ain't that something so really just knowing people at a specific\
Getting approved for grants\
time it just puts you in a position where it's like "Okay let's go ahead and take this you know to another level."\
Okay So now of course let's fast forward this a bit Um over the years you've gotten you know approved for grants and\
you know you've obviously secured funds and things of that sort but it wasn't always that easy Can you tell us how it\
was before that time frame when you said "Okay you know what i need to kind of figure this whole thing out." You know\
it's never easy I mean for the longest I was paying for things out of my own pocket uh doing GoFundMe and I would\
just ask for different donations and for people to support the ideas and the\
programs that I had And a lot of times I had to charge the participants which I didn't want to do because sometimes you\
know or a lot of times people didn't have the money to afford the programs that we were offering and and the people\
who need it the most oftentimes are the people who cannot afford it and and that was kind of what led me into the route\
of trying to figure out how can I get more funding well I was working at Rush University Medical Center for for a while If you're looking to get funding\
for your business with no minimum credit score required this includes term loans equipment financ and even fix and flip\
loans as well To learn more scan this QR code or click the link in the description below Now back to the video\
And Rush actually supported and backed a lot of our programs and initiatives in the beginning stages of Urban Mail\
Network getting started I left Rush I started working for this nonprofit um I'm not going to name the nonprofit\
organization but after a year um you know I got they they cut my position you\
know they try to take over they asked to try to they asked about how do I feel\
about bringing Urban Mail Network under them I said no and then probably about a\
month or two months later I get called into the office and and they're saying hey we no longer need you anymore wow\
position has been cut but while I was there The interesting thing about my role and my position there for this this\
nonprofit is that I was a director uh for community engagement and outreach So\
I was they had me on the fund development team where I had to learn about grant writing government contracts\
how all of that works So because that was my role in my position Yeah I began\
to learn about how government contracts works for nonprofits and then how to go\
about doing grant writing So I'm like "Wow this is you know this is not so bad I can actually do this for myself." So\
when I got let go I ended up literally um I said "You know what i'mma just take\
this time." Yeah Because I was getting an appointment right at that So I said "I'm gonna take this time and I'm going\
to just focus on building up my own organization." Yeah Start you know submitting for grants I start really\
setting up our the foundation for the organization to then go after government funding Of course you know the first few\
months you know were the first few times we got denied but then eventually things started to work out Um and here we are\
about three three years later um where we have what eight full-time staff members uh three part-time and you know\
so just we offer more programs and services that we're offering So since I've been laid off you know the\
organization has been able to expand and take off in a different level Wow that's\
amazing man And that's a great story to hear especi because you know you don't hear every day doctors being you know\
like fired or laid off or anything like that you know that's the whole point of you know actually achieving that level\
as well too congratulations on that by the way because I remember you know when you was just Marlin not not Dr hat Okay\
So but what I love about you man is that you haven't changed you know over the years and you just continue to pour into\
Naming a street after his grandmother\
uh you know the youth and just really giving people you know um just a glimpse of light especially in Chicago where a\
lot of just one of the many cities that people just give a bad rap to you know for a lot of these kids but you're doing\
so much so much Uh and then they also named a street after your grandmother Is that correct yeah So that that kind of\
goes into another story about connecting with government agencies and entities So we uh were donated a vacant lot on the\
block that I was raised with my grandmother So I grew up with my grandmother in the same house with Cook\
County Land Bank um in partnership with Rage donated about nine vacant lots to\
residents in that community So the thing is that we got this vacant lot We was one of the nine you know people real\
quick Be sure to download our free ebook today All you got to do is scan this QR code right here or click the link in the\
description below Now back to the video And I'm like "Okay great." So I ended up then once I got the lot I then submitted\
a proposal or for a grant um opportunity to the city of Chicago So I ended up\
getting the grant for Urban Network and then um to redevelop the lot So we end\
up changing this vacant parking lot into a basketball court And we did a mural on\
the court We put you know a fence a gate around it and did a mural on the front of it We put lights and electricity out\
there And then the second phase of it was that we was able to name the street after her as well So if you ride by\
there you will see her face and her name on this basketball court like on the you know like the wooden gate before you\
walk in Yeah And then um on the street that the name the street is named after her as well Wow You know it's crazy man\
Overqualified\
because that's the type of stuff you see on movies you know or people of celebrity stature but it's not just that\
You you you are really making an impact and continuing you know to do that you know as well But let's let's go let's\
get back back into I just want to kind of set the stage so people know you're not just because a lot of times people\
are just giving information they get one grant and all of a sudden they're a grant coach right um but you've gotten\
you've secured over eight figures of funding You've bought prop and by the way I've seen this everyone that's\
watching this I've seen this I'm talking about buying properties with grant funding right u renovating them So\
listen he's being modest but we going we going to get some we going to get some juice out of this today you know for sure But I'm just letting people know\
listen overqualified to talk about this type of stuff and he continues to do this as well Let's go and get into a\
couple of questions here One do you have to be in business a certain amount of time before you qualify for most\
government grants you do not There is no qualification that says you have to be in business for a certain amount of time\
However you know when it comes to writing the proposals they do ask about your level of experience\
when you are submitting for these proposals So how long have you been doing this work what makes you the\
expert right in the topic that you are submitting for or the issue that you're\
trying to address what I tell people often right sometime people feel like well I haven't really been doing this\
but if you have volunteered maybe it may not you may not have been paid or if you\
have experienced it so if you were homeless and then now you're trying to serve the homeless population well let's\
say if you was homeless for seven and eight years well then you understand that population that you're trying to serve because you was once a part of\
that demographic so you can speak to that so there's various ways that even if you're just recent recently starting\
your cor your business You know you can speak to the work that you've been doing whether that is as a volunteer um\
or as a person who has been a part of the demographics or the population that you're looking to serve And another\
thing too right you can always um do what I call a co-sponsored initiative right so you can co-sponsor a proposal\
with a nonprofit that has more experience and then that can kind of help with the leverage of of co-art\
partnering with a with another nonprofit to submit a proposal that way Wow Okay\
Documentation\
So you guys heard it here first You don't necessarily have to have be in business for a specific period of time\
Uh depending on of course you know which route you guys are trying to go you know for sure So man that's some good\
information to have Um as well one of the another question that I see that a lot of people end up having is okay I\
want to obviously get approved I know there's some grant writing in the process but what what type of documentation um or qualifications do\
people need to have in place when they say okay I'm now about to apply What do they need to have in place beforehand so\
typically you know when you're talking about when you're now about to submit or you're looking to submit for the a grant\
proposal in general right what is that that correct yeah Okay So I mean there's there's a a few things that that you\
would need depending on the the funer Sometime they want to see your um tax returns So um there may be a requirement\
that you may you know have to be within a certain range like you can't make over this or maybe they want to have a\
minimum amount that um you need to have to apply So tax returns from the\
previous year is is one Um another one is a document oftentimes that shows that\
you are a cuh organization that you're taxexempt So they will ask for that And then your\
paperwork you know showing that you have filed within the state So your articles of organization or incorporation\
depending on how you say it That that paperwork um is definitely needed Your EIN number I mean you're going to\
definitely need to to know that information And then your board of directors who you know give information\
about the board your leadership team So that can be for your executive director CEO to CFO COO They oftentimes ask\
information about those individuals So it's good to have bios for each of those\
people right that you can kind of give them and and then also typically to have information about your staff Now to kind\
of go a step further what I do is is that I typically like to put like a one or two pager together that gives an\
overview of the organization So that's talking about the work that we have done the demographics that we serve or\
currently serving and then the partners that we have other funders that we have\
received money from and then maybe just a breakdown of the budget when it comes to the amount of money that you're\
applying for So let's say if it's a $grant or $they want to see okay give us a breakdown right about\
what it is that you're planning to do with this And then they want to see a narrative with that particular budget So\
this is just kind of giving you high level because depending on the grant it could be a lot more that goes into it\
And then another thing that I tell people is that you never want to be the best kept secret And what do I mean by\
that is that if you're now submitting for you know a grant but then I go\
online and I can't find anything about your organization that's a problem If I'm going on Facebook I'm going on\
Instagram yeah LinkedIn or whatever and then nothing has been updated in months\
or up to a year That doesn't show me you are an active and engaged organization\
Um if I'm a reviewer you got to think about it the reviewers are human And so oftentimes what's the first thing people\
gonna do they're going to go to Google they're going to go look and I'm looking I'm like they haven't put nothing out\
there so are they really in months right as they say they are so these are all things that you want to make sure your\
website I mean these are just simple things that people really miss right and\
you know you should have a website and then I tell people another thing is is that you should have a a domain name to\
whatever organization that you have established so for example is mine is\
maron you know urban mailwork.org Right Right So if somebody when I'm sending an\
email then it ties back to show like oh we're a legitimate organization We have\
you know Urban Mail Network Instagram Urban Mail Network Chicago Facebook page So these are things that we have So\
everything is kind of coinciding So somebody going out there looking they can see that hey we actually doing this\
work and we are true and legitimate organization for what we're asking for\
money to do Man absolutely I'm so glad you brought that up because I know that there are a lot of there's a lot of just\
Trump Administration\
regular businesses that don't have an updated social media page updated\
website showing what they're doing And when you're especially when you're talking about getting approved for some\
type of grant approval and you just don't you're not showing them that like you said there are humans that are doing\
this to make sure that you are who you say you are because I'm sure there are people who apply for grants and they may\
not be you know legitimate you know so and they're trying to weed those type of people out as well By the way I did want\
to mention because you did come out with um a stepbystep guide So if you guys want to learn more about this you guys\
can scan the QR code right here at the bottom The link is also going to be in the description below as well But he\
actually created a stepbystep guide that walks you through this entire grant process Okay so again he's been approved\
for over eight figures of grants So listen this is some stuff that actually works Now I did have another question\
for you too Marlin and that is I know the Trump administration has made some\
major changes you know just grant approvals and things of that sort How have you seen that affect the grant\
approval industry or have you seen that affect much of anything as of right now it has not affected us Um there is still\
a lot of funding out there from the Biden administration right from the American Rescue Act I want to say those\
funds probably will not expire maybe until like the end of and then we\
may start seeing an effect you know from that But right now there's still funds\
that are left over from the Biden administration from that he put out there through that American Rescue Act\
And then people also have to remember too is that you know when it comes to government funding the city the state\
and the county are still able to generate their own funds right through the tax dollars that they raise So\
through tax dollars that they raise right from their constituents and the taxes that they charge they can then\
decide to say hey this is how we want to allocate this budget So if we was to give an example and take this a little\
deeper in the city of Chicago I don't know if you remember maybe a few months ago at the beginning of January there was this whole budget fight with it was\
the alman and the mayor and why is because they want they there was a big\
fight on the table about raising property taxes Yeah A lot of people was up in Upro were about that because they\
was like "Well right now you know our property you know bills and mortgage and everything is already high Raising our\
property taxes is just going to make it unaffordable where we're not going to be able to afford it." Well the thing is\
they was able to come to an agreement where I think they put you know extra money or they end up raising fair when\
it came to like Uber maybe pickup something like that They gonna still figure out a way to tax you They just\
didn't do it for Chicago gonna figure it out Well here's the thing Out of that particular budget the mayor for example\
right like he decided hey I want to put X amount of dollars towards workforce development for youth So then now they\
have you know they put out RFPs which is request for proposal for organizations to apply for funding um when it came to\
workforce development for youth in the city of Chicago Now those those\
particular dollars again came from the city of Chicago through their tax dollars and that money that was\
allocated So that's just kind of to give you an example of how you know the city\
the state and the county can still decide right based on that budget what\
it is they want to allocate money towards Now when they get money from the federal uh government it does help It\
does give an increase in dollars because the federal government does provide funding for them to then provide more\
money to different initiatives such as development you know whether that can be development of property buildings like I\
don't I don't know if you've seen like how there's been development with new buildings like in the city of Chicago\
like they have through the department of y I think I'm saying it right but that could have came from the federal\
government and then to the local right to where now they're distributing this\
money out that way Wow man But you know what and you know what it takes first\
off first off listen let me know in the comments section if you guys want us to bring Marlin back okay because again\
this is someone who's seen it from different standpoints Some people just learn about grants because they say\
"Okay I need to get grants." But you learned about it prior to that But you're seeing it from so many different perspectives like you just mentioned\
where you know if it's something that could benefit the community the neighborhood and instead of people just using their own funds like you said some\
of this stuff could have been you know paid for just with grants But you know and again I tell people all the time we\
don't know what we don't know Okay And I did want to confirm this because I'm\
sure some of the guests may have this question as well too You know credit doesn't play a role in getting approved\
for a grant Correct Because if a person let's say applied for a traditional loan they may get denied because of their\
credit if they get everything in place for their business or for their non uh\
profit then there's a chance that they can just get approved for the grant Correct Regardless of their credit\
That's correct So grants are not loans and they're not based on personal credit They're they're based on the work of the\
organization the impact that they're making and their qual and then the qualification and the structure that\
they have in place to carry out the task that they're that they're trying to do That is you know um typically where like\
how grant dollars are distributed So again it's it's money that you don't have to pay back It's not a loan So for\
example as you kind of mentioned earlier Yeah you know we got the land through Cook County Land Bank We got a building\
from Cook County Land Bank and then we were able I wrote another grant you know and I wrote that to Foot Locker and then\
we was able to get that funding to then pay for the development So we don't owe anything So we have this this basketball\
court now We owe Z on it We have the building that's almost finished It's it's a foot building but by the\
time it's completed we won't owe we don't have a loan Wow On on that building And then you know I had wrote a\
grant to get a passenger school bus We don't owe anything that you know we got a van We own it right out We got a\
game trailer So we we found a trailer on Facebook Market converted it and turned\
it into a game trailer And again we own it right out So these are things that I've been able to do you know through\
grant writing and and looking for grants And you know it's it's a numbers game as I call it right you're not going to do\
everything that you apply for but you have to be consistent You have to be diligent And one of the things that I do\
is that I I typically ask for feedback So if we don't receive a grant now not all the time do they give you feedback\
but sometimes they do right you got to stay on them I'll be like "Can you provide feedback?" And then I take that\
and I say "Okay well let me look at this next grant that I'm applying for and then see how I can approve on this."\
Because again you know I may apply for five and only get one But hey that's great right maybe that one grant is two\
two $It's just how it works out Um and then you may apply for five and get\
three out of the five right or sometime you might get all five It just depends But you keep going and you keep being\
consistent and you know you'll eventually get what is needed for you Man that's amazing That that really is\
amazing And I honestly just to see everything unfold you know is has been amazing to watch as well too you know\
What is an unrestricted grant\
knowing you So let me ask this question too I know that there are people watching this that say "Okay you know\
what i know I'm more than likely going to need some source of transportation\
you know for my business or nonprofit I know that it would be great to have uh\
put myself in a position where I can get a building Can you walk us through not every single step but what that process\
was like is it the same as asking for or I would say applying for just a normal\
grant or was it different because you were trying to get um a transportation vehicle or the property was that process\
any different it is different Right So you have some grants They're they're\
very strict about what it is that you can do with the money right so some grants yeah you cannot buy vehicles you\
can't go purchase real estate you can't go do development But one of the things is is that I would tell people go look\
for what is called a unrestricted grant An unrestricted grant is that a grant to\
where they don't restrict what you can do with the dollars So if you need to buy a van if you need to buy a car to\
transport people or maybe you need to buy a building then you can do that with those unrestricted dollars Um and so\
that's why it's very um important that you're literally looking at the type of grants that you are applying for So then\
you understand what it is you can do and what you cannot do Because again you know some grants don't allow you to\
purchase and do something like some grants you can't buy food where some can't right so it it just depends and\
you just have to understand what is it you know that that you are I put in there So I tell people and here's a a\
gym that I would drop right so let's say we have business owners on on your call which I'm sure you do Um and I will tell\
people is that they should start a cwhich is a nonprofit and then they should have the forprofit side which is\
your LLC So you can have the same name So let's just say if I had Heywood LLC\
and then if I had Heywood NFP which is Haywood Notforprofit Now I don't have neither one of those but I'm just giving\
an example Yeah But Haywood you know not for profofit can then be applying for\
funding and grants that that only gives money to a cBut I can still have\
Haywood LLC to then do the for-profit business work that I want to do Well with the nonprofit side I can then be\
applying for funding let's say for a space to provide service whether that's to youth to seniors whatever it is that\
I'm trying to do right and then let's say now you got the funding for it and then you can pay for your rental of a\
space or office And then you know you can also then have your for-profit\
business then being housed in that same building But then now you know if you think about the biggest expenses that\
people need to pay right as a business owner it is a space whether that is you\
know as a as a store retail office but then if you're able to now get that covered and you don't have to you know\
take care of that that could be something that you can you know get taken care of Wow Listen I hope you guys\
Summary\
didn't miss that gem For those who didn't I'm going to give you the summary Okay If you have a business you should\
strongly consider adding a nonprofit to that business And you say it could even\
have the same name That is man that's crazy And I remember just a conversation I was having with you to add to that\
where you were you had mentioned that if the if the nonforprofit needs something\
and it has to get it done from a contractor and if your business just so\
happens to be it can solve that situation You're essentially able to pay the business you know at know as a\
contractor using those government funds assuming of course everything makes sense to do so man that that was amazing\
you know within itself So and then last but not least before we get up out of here uh Dr Haywood I did have another\
question as well too Um what are some are there any other common mistakes i know you talked about the website and\
things of that sort Anything else that you see that people make mistakes on and it really keeps them from getting\
approved getting approved for a grant or getting approved for the non not forprofit Which one you know let's go\
ahead and go with just for grants for now Okay Um I mean it could be a lot of things right it can be the the deadline\
because this has happened to me right let's say the deadline was today okay p.m Well you submitted it at\
Well then they send you back an email saying "Well you didn't meet the deadline right?" A lot of these funders\
be very meticulous and they're very strict about the deadline Um so if you know that you have a problem with\
meeting deadlines then give yourself the deadline the day before That's that's number one Number two um when it comes\
to just the budget right um like how how when it comes to putting together the\
budget like you have to make sure that you're putting together a budget that makes sense for the amount of money that\
you are asking for or the money that they're allowing you to ask for And if they're looking at your budget and it\
doesn't make sense um you're not able to explain what you're trying to do for the funds that can be something that can be\
to to a mistake And then another thing too is that when you are being too general and broad but you're not being\
specific enough So if you say "I just want to help the community." Well how do you want to help the community what\
particular community do you want to help and then tell me about the community that you want to serve right what is the\
issue but if you're just saying "I want to solve homelessness." Well that's broad You got to be more specific Give\
me data Give me information And then once you give me the problem then lay it out how your organization and the money\
that you're being provided is going to then help solve or kind of be a part of\
the solution So make sure that you're able to do those things And sometime people just make mistakes of being too\
broad too general and then not getting specific in the weeds There you go Listen you guys are you guys are getting\
a master class you know on this you know for sure Well listen uh Dr Hey we greatly appreciate you uh being here as\
well And then also to everyone that's watching this he does have a stepby-step guide that not only walks you through\
how he was able to get up to eight figures into funding but also how to we\
didn't go too deep into how to start the nonprofit and things of that So I really want to just focus on the grant piece\
Ways to Successfully Remove Charge-Offs from Credit Reports!\
charge offs are one of\
the most unpredictable and damaging\
items that appear on a credit report so\
today I'm going to share three fast\
removal methods and give you the best\
tools to get the job done so you better\
stick around\
my name is Daniel Rosen and welcome to\
credit repair business secrets\
The Impact of Charge-Offs\
charge-offs are one of the most\
unpredictable and harmful items that\
appear on a credit report they damage\
your relationship with lenders they make\
it difficult to get approved for lines\
of credit and the impact of a charge off\
depends entirely on your overall credit\
history your payment history and\
additional personal factors so there\
isn't just one foolproof process to\
remove them but there are three methods\
that do work consistently and all they\
require are patience persistence\
pressure and the right dispute letters\
to get the job done here's how this\
relates to us for anyone new to credit\
repair a charge off is a financial term\
used to describe a debt that A lender\
has given up trying to collect\
charge-offs typically happen when a\
borrower fails to make payments for an\
extended period of time between and\
days but charge offs also happen\
even if payments were being made for\
example if the payment women just didn't\
meet the monthly minimum and the account\
became delinquent or if the borrower\
files for bankruptcy charge-offs are\
long-term problems they live on credit\
reports for seven years from the date of\
the first missed or late payment on the\
account their impact varies wildly\
depending on the circumstance but just\
one charge off can drop a score anywhere\
from to points making them one of\
the most unpredictable and dangerous\
items in all of credit repair\
considering the charge-offs give your\
payment history a black eye hurt your\
credit utilization and force you to deal\
with debt collectors credit Heroes need\
to treat their removal as one of the\
most important things to focus on here's\
How Charge-Offs Work\
the thing to remember when a charge off\
happens the lender writes off the debt\
as a loss on their financial statements\
sometimes they attempt to collect the\
debt themselves but usually they sell it\
to third-party debt collectors for\
pennies on the dollar or or they lease\
that debt to a debt collection firm but\
no matter who owns the debt you still\
have the obligation to repay even if the\
original creditor is no longer involved\
you owe whoever required that debt even\
if you remove it from your planner\
report so it's important to remember\
that technically you still owe that debt\
and they can sue you for it now if you\
pay off the debt tied to the account\
before the seven year clock is up it's\
going to show as a paid charge off on\
your credit report paying off the\
account might help to improve your\
scores or it might make lenders more\
likely to approve you for credit in the\
future but that's not guaranteed from a\
credit scoring perspective what matters\
most is how recently the charge off\
happens and if it was recent removing\
that charge off from your credit report\
is a high priority no matter what the\
repayment status is here's why this is\
important your creditor is paying taxes\
on the debt that you owe your debt is an\
asset to their company so when you don't\
pay they lose money and when they're\
forced to hang on the debt they lose\
even more money this is why in many\
cases creditors are willing to negotiate\
a settlement on a Charged off debt\
because it's in their best interest to\
receive some payment rather than none at\
all here's what you need to know it's\
best to avoid charge-offs whenever\
possible but if you're stuck with them\
here are three removal methods that work\
and all it takes is patience persistence\
and pressure and the right dispute\
letters to get the job done the first\
Charge-Off Removal Method \
method sends standard dispute letters\
directly to the credit bureaus\
requesting verification of the debt and\
the removal of any unverified items or\
factual errors from the credit report we\
call these first letters round one\
regardless of the type of account the\
bureaus are required to contact that\
furniture that reported your information\
and verify the debt after contacting the\
furnishers they only have days to\
respond if they don't respond in time\
the items you disputed are deleted\
automatically but Boom the second method\
Charge-Off Removal Method \
challenge the charge off with the\
original creditor using section of\
the fair and accurate credit transaction\
act or send a validation letter to the\
debt collector directly requesting that\
they prove that the debt is accurate if\
the bureaus or debt collectors do not\
respond appropriately or if they respond\
with a stall letter you may need to\
request a reinvestigation demand to know\
their method of verification or send\
them a warning letter if necessary if\
you don't have the round one validation\
reinvestigation method of verification\
and warning letters that I'm talking\
about you can download them all for free\
at creditrepaircloud.com\
dispute Dash letter Dash templates I'll\
also put the link over there in the show\
notes now this process yes it does take\
time but if you've done all this and you\
still don't have the result that you\
want you may want to file a complaint\
with the cfpb the FTC or your state\
attorney general or consider bringing in\
an fcra attorney to advise you further\
Charge-Off Removal Method \
now if the debt is verified and\
validated you're really left with only\
one option the third method offer the\
lender or debt collector a pay per\
delete negotiate have the charge off\
removed from your credit report in\
exchange for paying off the debt you can\
try to offer partial settlement in\
return for the deletion of the account\
but most debt collectors will want the\
full payment this method tends to be\
successful because it's a win-win\
situation for you and the Creditor your\
debt is paid and the charge off is\
deleted just make sure you get proof for\
the agreement in writing before moving\
My Final Point\
forward here's my final Point\
charge-offs are unpredictable damaging\
and a pain to remove from credit reports\
but don't let that describe towards you\
patience persistence pressure and the\
right dispute letters will get the job\
How can you get the bank's money with an paydex score\
so you have an \
pay to score on your business now what\
how do you get the bank's money how do\
you get these unsecured business credit\
cards how you get these business lines\
of credit how do you go to different\
financial institutions and get funding\
well let's unpack that but before we do\
make sure you subscribe to my YouTube\
channel called London Business usual I'm\
your host make sure you hit that\
notification Bell make sure you like if\
you like the content that I'm about to\
provide for you today it really helps\
the channel out I appreciate you all\
right so let's get into it you build up\
your business pay that score right you\
got an pay that score but first let's\
break down what is a Payday score well a\
Payday score is connected to your dun\
and Brad which is a major business\
credit bill because remember you have\
three major business credit bureaus\
there's more out there but let's just\
talk about the three for today video you\
have your Experian business Equifax\
business and you're done and Brad AKA\
your payday score now your payday scores\
tells vendors tell suppliers do you pay\
your bills on time over a period of time\
so if you do based on your payday score\
number it allows them to extend business\
lines of credit to you when I mean they\
I'm referring to other companies so\
remember\
pay that score is connected to your is\
part of your business credit so business\
credit business funding and bank credit\
these are three different concepts so\
when you're building up your payday\
score You're Building business credit\
right so business credit is when you I\
said this on my previous videos but I'm\
just going to recap you have to go back\
to my previous video to watch as far as\
me giving a breakdown with his business\
credit but I'll give you a quick\
synopsis business credit is when you\
leverage your business by yourself\
using your eia number by yourself you're\
going to go to other companies and\
you're going to open up lines of credit\
with those companies\
so it's based on the structure of your\
business remember that's the first step\
you have to properly structure your\
business you have to build a fundable\
foundation get the LLC get an EIN\
getting it done to Brad uh getting a\
virtual office Etc\
so that's the first step properly\
structuring your business of\
businesses get denied on business credit\
applications because the unverified\
information and also misinterpret\
information\
lenders can't find you if they do find\
you the information is off so now your\
business is deemed as being fraudulent\
and we don't want that so properly\
structure your business number two\
you're gonna also you gotta make sure\
that you properly build up a business\
credit profile build up your business\
credit score by adding business credit\
trade lines\
now depending on what trade lines you\
add that's going to determine whether or\
not you're going to get any loan from\
these financial institutions so if we go\
and get vendors trade line and supplier\
trade lines on our business credit\
profile\
meaning we'll focused on our done and\
Brad\
AKA I pay that score\
then it's going to be almost impossible\
to go to these Banks and go to these\
Finance institutions to get along that's\
one of the biggest misconceptions out\
there one of the biggest credit myths\
out there hey build up your pay that\
score and then go to these Banks and get\
these loans that's not going to happen\
because I'm going to tell you right now\
what\
most people will not tell you when it\
comes to business building business\
credit\
these lenders these creditors these\
financial institutions out there they do\
not care about your payday score\
I'm going to repeat that lenders do not\
care about your payday score why because\
your payday score is connected to vendor\
trade Line supply your trade lines\
lenders focus on financial trade lines\
so when I tell you to build business\
credit I want to tell you to build\
business credit with financial trade\
lines as lenders actually care about\
such as one is like secure business\
credit cards those are Financial trade\
lines so we have to focus on the proper\
trade lines to build a a strong business\
credit profile so if you're going\
through the tier system tier one tier\
two tier three tier four where you're\
getting the the quill the Granger the\
Uline you're getting a the crown office\
supplies the Staples you got a Home\
Depot the Dell you only focus on vendors\
and supplier trade lines\
it's almost impossible for you to go to\
the banks and get loans and get business\
lines of credit\
because your credit profile is not\
strong enough or you don't have the data\
points on your business credit profile\
that these lenders and these financial\
institutions determine whether or not\
your business is credible your business\
is lendable right the data doesn't\
provide that information so this is why\
you're getting turned down for any type\
of business credit because you're not\
building the proper data points you're\
focused too much on your dun and Brad\
and lenders do not care about your done\
and Brad\
yeah I know I got to be the bad guy to\
break the news to you I know I know it's\
hard but somebody has to do it\
because I want you to be successful I\
want you to properly build your and\
structure your business credit profile\
out so you can get qualified for\
business funding\
which is different from business credit\
right so once you qualify for business\
funding when you focus on financial\
trade lines now you can go to these\
Banks and get business lines of credit\
fifty thousand hundred thousand you can\
get business credit lines right\
unsecured business credit cards business\
auto loans you can go get these things\
because you have Financial trade lines\
reporting on your business credit\
profile\
so let's not focus on down and Brands so\
much let's focus on Experian business\
Equifax business and let's focus on uh\
business owner credit\
