RE: <<ITEM-Description>> <<ITEM-Account>> <<ITEM-Amount>> To Whom It May Concern: I have obtained a credit report from [[SELECT CREDIT BUREAU FROM RADIO BUTTON IN RED BAR AT TOP]]<<CB-NAME>>. It shows that the above account with your company is being reported as [[ENTER NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE THIS TEXT]] days late [[ENTER NUMBER OF TIMES IN BEFORE THIS TEXT]] times. According to my records, the account was under dispute at that time for returned merchandise. I had informed the credit department that handles my account and they assured me they would take care of it. This information is damaging my credit rating. I appreciate if you would verify the information and correct it with the credit bureau above as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If the information is purged and cannot be verified, please instruct the credit bureau to remove the account from my credit report. Thank you for your prompt response.
