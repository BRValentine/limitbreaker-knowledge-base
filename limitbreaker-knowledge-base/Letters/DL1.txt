INITIAL LETTER AFTER RECEIVING A COLLECTION LETTER <<Todays-Date>> <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> <<VP-Company>> <<VP-Address>> I am writing in response to your letter because I do not believe I owe what you say I owe. Being the first time I've heard from you on this matter and in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Section 809(b): Validating Debts: "If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty- day period described in subsection (a) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector." Therefore, I request from you the following information: 1 - Name of creditor whom you say the debt is owed. 2 - Total amount of debt 3 - Copy of Contract or other verification bearing by signature. 4 - Proof that you are license to collect debts in the the state of <<UDF- 08>> and copy of current bond on your company I am aware of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. therefore you cannot add interest or fees except those allowed by the original contract or state law. Also, you do not have to respond to this dispute, but if you do, any attempt to collect this debt without validating it, violates the FDCPA. I am keeping accurate records of this and all communications with your company including the recording of all phone communications and I will not hesitate to advise [[my Congressman ]]the State Attorney General and the FTC, I am hereby disputing this debt, therefore until validation, the information of this debt should be considered inaccurate. So, you must report to any Credit Bureau or Credit Reporting Agency that you deal with of my dispute with this debt. The report of information knowing of its inaccuracy or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ยง 1681s-2 and if you pursue a judgment before validating this debt is a failure of the FDCPA Additionally, if you don't own this debt, you must also send a copy of the present dispute to the original creditor to make it aware of such dispute. Thanking you in advance, <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>>
