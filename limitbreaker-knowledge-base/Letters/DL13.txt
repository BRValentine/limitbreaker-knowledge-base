RE: <<ITEM-Description>> Acct: <<ITEM-Account>> Amount: <<ITEM-Amount>> Attention: Credit Department You report my current account as [[ENTER NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE THIS TEXT]] days late with the credit bureaus. Since I believe this to be incorrect, please forward the following information to me immediately: 1. A complete summary of all my account activities since the account was opened - including all charges incurred, all payments made, late charges, interest, date payments received and date payments posted, and any other debits or credits to the account. 2. All documents and charge slips signed by me and/or authorized users that support the amount of the claimed obligation. 3. A copy of my original application showing the terms of our agreement. If you cannot or will not supply me with this pertinent information, then under The Fair Credit Reporting Act, I demand that you cease reporting this information and instruct the credit bureaus to remove the late payment record from my credit reports immediately. Sincerely, __________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
