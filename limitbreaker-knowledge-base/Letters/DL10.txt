<<Todays-Date>> VIA CERTIFIED MAIL **Original Creditor Address** <<VP-Company>> <<VP-Address>> Legal Department, RE: Account # <<ITEM-Account>> Your company is currently reporting a negative listing to the three major credit bureaus (Experian, Trans Union, and Equifax) regarding the above referenced account. Based on my recollection and my records, I can find no reason for you reporting such a history. If youâ€™ll review your records I think that you will find your reported notations are not only invalid and incomplete, but both inaccurate and incorrect. The erroneous status of your credit reporting records and methods is/are unacceptable and is causing me hardship. Pursuant to Title 15, Section 1666 of the United States Code, I formally request the following documentary evidence pertaining to this account: 1. A copy of the original credit application showing the terms of the agreement. 2. Original documentation used to compile a summary of all account activities, including all payments made, late charges, interest, date of payments received, date of payments posted, charges made, and date of charges posted. 3. Copies of all original documents and financial instruments that have been used by your company that has authorized you to post the disputed late payments to my credit file with the named credit bureaus above in concern. 4. Copies of all charge slips, invoices, promissory notes, and all other documents proving indebtedness. 5. Copies of all documents sent to me regarding this account. This information and documentation is critical and time is of the essence. Within less than 15 days, I will be damaged partially because of the discrepancy of your reported records. The above noted code requires your response within fifteen (15) business days. Your prompt attention will be greatly appreciated. I hereby request that your response be mailed to the address listed below. If you find that your information and documentation does not support the negative history reported to the three credit bureaus, I invite you to submit a completed Universal Data Form to the above said bureaus in order to remove the negative notations and provide me with a letter indicating that the negative item(s) has/have been removed. Upon removal of the negative notations, I agree to hold your company harmless from any and all inconvenience and/or damage related thereto. Thank you in advance, Sincerely, !!DO NOT SIGN!! <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SSN: <<UDF-10>>
