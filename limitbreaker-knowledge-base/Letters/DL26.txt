RE: EXPLANATORY STATEMENT TO MY CREDIT REPORT To Whom It May Concern: In accordance to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, please add the following statement to my credit report: [[ENTER YOUR OWN STORY BEFORE THIS TEXT OR USE A USER DEFINED FIELD TO HOLD THE HISTORY AND THEN MERGE THAT FIELD IN THIS TEMPALTE BEFORE THIS MESSAGE]]. [[Example: On December 10,2008, my wife became very ill. The doctor and hospital bills have exceeded the limits allowed by our health insurance. So, we had to liquidate all of our savings and checking accounts. My wife lost her job, and I was not able to work full time. Because I was not able to fulfill my credit obligations, we, taking advise of our attorney, filed for bankruptcy. I am now attempting to fulfill all my credit obligations.]] Sincerely, _____________________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
