RE: <<ITEM-Description>> Acct: <<ITEM-Account>> Amount: <<ITEM-Amount>> Attention: Credit Department Manager Your company is reporting inaccurate information on my credit reports. I wrote 30 days ago and requested the following information to support your claim: 1. A complete summary of all my account activities since the account was opened - including all charges incurred, all payments made, late charges, interest, date payments received and date payments posted, and any other debits or credits to the account. 2. All documents and charge slips signed by me and/or authorized users that support the amount of the claimed obligation. 3. A copy of my original application showing the terms of our agreement. As of the date of this letter, I have yet to hear from you and you are still reporting my current account as [[ENTER NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE THIS MESSAGE]] days late. Either provide what was requested, or immediately instruct the credit bureaus to remove the negative rating from my credit reports. By reporting inaccurate information without proof, you are in direct violation of The Fair Credit Reporting Act. You have 10 days to contact me and notify the credit bureaus. Otherwise, I will instruct my attorney to proceed with legal action against you on this matter. Sincerely, __________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
