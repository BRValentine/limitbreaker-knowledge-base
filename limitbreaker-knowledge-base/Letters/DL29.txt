RE: PLEASE UPDATE RECORDS Dear Sir / Madam: I write to ask that you update your records regarding this account. I have received written confirmation from <<VP-Company>> in reference to account <<ITEM-Account>> FOR <<ITEM-Amount>> that they no longer report the derogatory credit information that you have included on my credit report. Contact them to verify this and remove the entry(ies) from my credit report immediately. By reporting information that is not verifiably accurate, you are in violation of The Fair Credit Reporting Act. Following this act, please send me notification when these accounts have been investigated and then deleted. Include an updated copy of my credit report, which should have no additional charges to me. Sincerely, _____________________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
