ATTN: Consumer Relations Department To Whom It May Concern: I have attached a copy of a court-ordered judgment so the following needs to be deleted from my credit report immediately: [[ENTER ALL CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE DONE BASED ON COURT ORDER BOFORE THIS TEXT]]. I have included a current copy of my credit report with these items clearly indicated. Because this action requires no investigation, this needs to be accomplished within seven business days. Upon removal of these items, please send me an updated copy of my credit report, which should hold no additional costs to me. Thank you for your prompt response. Sincerely, _____________________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
