RE: Notification to cease all communication Dear Sir / Madam: This is to serve as your legal notice under federal law (The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) to cease all communication with me in reference to the account above. If you fail to heed this notice, I will file a formal complaint against you with the FTC, who is responsible for enforcement, the American Collectors Association, and the State Attorney General's office. I have decided that I do not desire to work with a collection agency under any circumstances. I will no longer honor any of your attempts at collecting on this account. I understand that you may not contact me except to inform me of any legal action you can or will take in regard to this account. I will contact the creditor and resolve this matter directly. You are also notified that if your company, as a result of this notice places any adverse items against my credit report, I will not hesitate to take all appropriate legal action against you. Sincerely, _______________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
