Dear Sirs: As you can see by the state of this account, I am experiencing major financial difficulties. I intend to pay my bill due to your company, however, at this time I am not able to bring this account current and I'm afraid that I could not consistently maintain any payment arrangements we may be able to work out. If you look back on the history of this account, you will see that regular payments were being made until only recently. I would like to get back in good standing with your company. Please provide me with the following information to help me evaluate my situation: [[AMOUNT CURRENTLY DUE]] [[BREAKDOWN OF LATE FEES, OVER LIMIT FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES BEING BILLED THAT ARE NOT PURCHASES MADE]] [[DATE OF LAST REGULAR PAYMENT MADE ON THIS ACCOUNT]] [[CURRENT STATUS OF HOW THIS ACCOUNT REFLECTS ON YOUR RECORDS AND CREDIT HISTORY REPORTS]] If you feel there is still a need to contact me by phone, please contact me only at the following phone number [[PHONE NUMBER]], as I am prohibited from receiving personal calls at my place of employment. With your help, I look forward to resolving this unfortunate situation promptly. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding. Sincerely, __________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
