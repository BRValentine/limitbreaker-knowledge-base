Re: Mixed personal information Dear Sirs: It appears that there is information belonging to someone else currently being reported on my credit report. I request that you investigate these accounts immediately and have them removed from my credit record. My personal information (and the only information that should be reported) is as follows: Name: <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> Address: <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>> To the best of my knowledge, the following accounts listed below do not belong to me: Description: <<ITEM-Description>> Account #: <<ITEM-Account>> Amount: <<ITEM-Amount>> I request these accounts be removed from my report. If necessary, please contact the creditor reporting these errors and have them verify this information they are reporting. If they cannot or will not verify this information, please have their mistakes removed permanently from my credit records. If any of the information above is verified to be correct as it is being reported, then I also request knowledge of the procedure you used to verify this information and the name, address, phone number, and any other contact information of the person who verified this information. I further request that you add a comment to each of these Trade lines stating that it is "In Dispute -- Mixed Information" until I am able to use the contact information you have provided to correct the situation. I trust you will send me a corrected credit report once this investigation is complete. Sincerely, _____________________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
