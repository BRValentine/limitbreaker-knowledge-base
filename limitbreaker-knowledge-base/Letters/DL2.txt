Dear Sirs: An account from your company is appearing on my credit report. I am not aware of having any account with your company. I request that you investigate this matter and provide me with the following: A legible copy of the original signed agreement for this account, which should show my personal information, as well as my signature. Name and contact information of the original creditor, if this account was transferred or purchased. Any other documentation verifying the account is, in fact, mine. If you cannot or will not provide me this information, then I formally request you send me a letter stating that this account does not belong to me and that it will be removed from my credit reports. Until this matter is cleared up, I firmly request that you stop reporting this account altogether. Please give this matter your prompt attention. Sincerely, _______________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
