<<Todays-Date>> VIA CERTIFIED MAIL <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> <<VP-Company>> <<VP-Address>> Legal Department: Your papers attached hereto are refused, denied and returned for fraud . All parties parties must agree to a debt claim to be enforceable and legal. I never agreed to contract with your company. Additionally, evidence of debt alone does not make you a person entitled to collect. If your presumption is youâ€™ve obtained tactic or implied consent, you have now been put on notice that any subrogation has now been rebutted and any presumption of consent is hereby void for fraud. Further, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act does not give you the authority to force me to consent to contract with you. Show me your lawful authority to enforce an alleged debt claim against me to my detriment without my consent. You are also in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by the use of misleading representations and unfair and deceptive practices in the attempted collection of a debt. If you cannot substantively answer within 15 days and either prove your authority or prove specific contractual obligation between you and me, then cease and desist and immediately remove any derogatory reporting to the credit bureaus. Further, as an act of good faith, provide me with written confirmation this matter has been resolved and any negative reporting to the credit bureaus has ceased. Should you ignore this letter and continue your collection efforts and reporting to Credit Bureaus, I will have no other choice but to have my local Congressman forward your fraudulent papers to the Federal Trade Commission, Attorney General and the Postal Inspection Service for further scrutiny. Please know that as of receipt of this notification, it is now time stamped by certified mail. I look forward to an uneventful resolution of this matter. Thank you for your cooperation in advance, !!DO NOT SIGN!! <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>>
