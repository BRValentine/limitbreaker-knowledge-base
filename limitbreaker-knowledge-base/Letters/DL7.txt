RE: REQUEST FOR NEW PAYMENT PLAN Dear Sir / Madam, According to your records, I owe you a total of $ [[ENTER DOLLAR AMOUNT IN ITEMS TO DISPUTE]]<<ITEM-Amount>>. I intend to pay you in full, along with all my other creditors. To achieve this, I have created a plan that will put me into a stable financial position. I opened a "Debt Clearance Account", and have reduced my living expenses. I will deposit 20% of my income into that account each month. I will pay each of my creditors a percentage from it, based on how much each is owed. This will provide sufficient resources for me to live on, prevent me from falling further into debt, and will allow for the timely retirement of all my current debt. The percentage I owe your company comes to exactly $ [[ENTER PROJECTED MONTHLY DOLLAR AMOUNT BEFORE THIS MESSAGE OR USE DISPUTE ITEM AMOUNT FIELD AS APPROPRIATE]] per month. Effective next month, and every month after that, you will receive a check from me until my debt to you is gone. I understand this is not the figure I had originally agreed to pay you, nor does it allow for the accrual of any additional interest. However, since all my other creditors have already accepted this new repayment plan, I'm sure you will agree that consistently receiving something each month is more desirable than receiving nothing - being the alternative - and having no recourse but to charge off the account or pursue legal action against me. Because getting out of debt and restoring credit ratings are two of my primary objectives, I require that you change how you report this account to the credit bureaus. The account must be unrated and all adverse information and derogatory comments must be removed. As you can understand, if you will not comply with any portion of this proposal, it would not be in my best interest to include you in this repayment plan. Please acknowledge your acceptance of this plan to me at the below address. Sincerely, __________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
