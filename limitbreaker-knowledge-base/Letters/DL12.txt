RE: <<ITEM-Description>> Acct: <<ITEM-Account>> Amount: <<ITEM-Amount>> To Whom It May Concern: I have obtained a credit report from [[SELECT CREDIT BUREAU FROM RADIO BUTTONS IN RED BAR AT TOP]]<<CB-NAME>>.

According to my records, the account was under dispute at that time for returned merchandise. I had informed the credit department that handles my account and they assured me they would take care of it. This information is damaging my credit rating. I would appreciate that you would verify this information by returning this letter and checking one of the following. That way, I can forward it to the credit bureau and have this issue resolved: ___________ Consumer is correct: the information is reported incorrectly. ___________ Consumer is incorrect. ___________ Information was purged after ______ months Verified by: __________________________________ Date verified: ___________________________________ Thank you for your prompt response.
