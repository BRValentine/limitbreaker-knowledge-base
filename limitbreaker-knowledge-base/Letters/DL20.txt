RE: <<ITEM-Description>> <<ITEM-Account>> <<ITEM-Amount>> To Whom It May Concern: I have obtained a credit report from [[SELECT CREDIT BUREAU FROM RADIO BUTTON IN RED BAR AT TOP]]<<CB-NAME>>. It shows that the above account with your company is being reported as late. According to my best recollection, I have always paid this account promptly and accordingly. This information which is incorrect, is damaging my credit rating. I would appreciate if you would verify the information and correct it with the credit bureau above as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If the information is purged and cannot be verified, please instruct the credit bureau to remove the account from my credit report. Thank you for your prompt response.
