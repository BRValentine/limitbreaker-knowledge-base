RE: <<ITEM-Description>> <<ITEM-Account>> <<ITEM-Amount>> Attention: Credit Department Manager Your company is reporting inaccurate information on my credit reports. It is very damaging to my credit rating. I have only had one account with you, but you are reporting it three separate times as three separate occurrences to the credit bureaus. You are also reporting it as both an open account and as a settled account. I wrote 30 days ago and requested that you either remove 2 of the occurrences or send proof that I opened 3 accounts with you. As of the date of this letter, I have yet to hear from you. Still, you are incorrectly reporting on my credit report two settled accounts and one open account. By reporting inaccurate information without proof of its accuracy you are in direct violation of The Fair Credit Reporting Act. You have 15 days to return the attached document to me and to notify the credit bureaus of the correct status of my account. Otherwise, I will instruct my attorney to proceed with legal action against you for violating my rights under The Fair Credit Reporting Act.
