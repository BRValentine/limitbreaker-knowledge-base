RE: <<ITEM-Description>> Acct: <<ITEM-Account>> Amount: <<ITEM-Amount>> Dear Mr. [[ENTER PRESIDENT OF THE CREDITOR COMPANY VIRTUAL PERSONA CREDITORâ€™S NAME FIELD]]<<VP-Name>>: I have been a good customer of your company for the last ten years. I recently wrote to your credit department 3 times to try to clear up a misunderstanding. Your credit department is reporting to the credit bureaus that I'm a bad- credit risk. I asked them to stop reporting this incorrect information on my credit reports. They refused. I later asked for documentation proving the accuracy of their reporting. They refused to provide any evidence of it whatsoever. It is very inconsiderate to treat one of your long-time customers this way. I understand that mistakes happen. However, if your company is not able to provide proof of this obligation, as requested, I demand that you stop reporting the negative information to the credit bureaus. If you continue, your company will remain in direct violation of The Fair Credit Reporting Act, and furthermore it is keeping me from purchasing a home for my family. I appreciate your prompt response. Sincerely, __________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
