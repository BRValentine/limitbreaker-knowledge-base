RE: <<ITEM-Description>> <<ITEM-Account>> <<ITEM-Amount>> To Whom It May Concern: I have obtained a credit report from [[SELECT CREDIT BUREAU FROM RADIO BUTTON IN RED BAR AT TOP]]<<CB-NAME>>. It shows that the above account with your company is being reported as [[ENTER NUMBER OF DAYS BEFORE THIS TEXT]] days late. According to my records, I sent my payment on time for that incident, but your company misplaced my check, and later credited my account with the correct amount. This incorrect information is damaging my credit rating. I appreciate if you would verify the information and correct it with the credit bureau listed above as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If the information is purged and cannot be verified, please instruct the credit bureau to remove the account from my credit report. Thank you for your prompt response.
