Dear Sir / Madam, An old account from your company is appearing on my credit report. I have not used it for some time and would like it listed as "closed at consumer's request" on my credit files. I would appreciate confirmation of this correction. Thank you. Sincerely, __________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
