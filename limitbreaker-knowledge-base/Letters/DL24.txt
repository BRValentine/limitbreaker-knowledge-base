<<Todays-Date>> <<CB-NAME>> <<CB-ADDRESS>> RE: Unauthorized Inquiry in my Credit Report from <<VP-Company>> Legal department, Recently, I received a copy of my credit report from <<CB-NAME>>. The credit report showed a credit inquiry that I do not recall authorizing. I understand that you shouldn't be allowed to put an inquiry on my file unless I have authorized it. Please remove the <<VP-Company>> inquiry from my report within the 30-day time allowed investigation period as pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b section 604 ( c ) (3) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act whereby a consumer reporting agency shall not furnish to any person a record of inquiries in connection with a credit or insurance transaction that is not initiated by a consumer. Please, either provide me with strict proof I authorized this inquiry such as signed application or contract or recorded telephone call or delete the inquiry immediately. If you ignore this letter and do not delete the inquiry or do not provide strict proof of authorization I will have no other alternative than to have my local Congressman promptly forward a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and Attorney General for further scrutiny of this matter. Thanking you in advance, ____________________ <<First-Name>> <<Last-Name>> <<Address>> SS: <<UDF-10>> DOB: <<UDF-14>>
