# Step-by-Step Guide to Building Tier 1 and Tier 2 Business Credit with Accounts Reporting to Dun & Bradstreet in 2025

This guide provides a detailed, actionable process for building business credit using five accounts that report to Dun & Bradstreet (D&B), as outlined in the provided transcript. It focuses on two Tier 1 accounts (Murphy USA, WEX) and three Tier 2 accounts (U.S. Bank, OfficeMax, Lowe’s) to help establish and scale your business credit profile. These steps are designed for Limitbreaker users to leverage business credit for wealth-building, avoiding personal credit reliance and maximizing funding opportunities.

## Prerequisites
- A registered business entity (e.g., LLC, corporation) in good standing with the Secretary of State.
- An Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS.
- A D-U-N-S Number from Dun & Bradstreet (free at [dnb.com](https://www.dnb.com)).
- A business bank account in the business’s name.
- For Tier 2 accounts: A business email and domain (e.g., info@yourbusiness.com, www.yourbusiness.com).
- An Excel spreadsheet or similar tool to track account applications, trade lines, and payment history.
- Commitment to using business credit for income-generating or growth-oriented expenses (e.g., equipment, marketing, software).

## Why Build Business Credit?
- **Faster Growth**: Business credit can be built in 3–6 months, securing $50,000–$100,000+ in funding, compared to slower personal credit rebuilding.
- **Higher Limits**: Business credit offers larger limits (e.g., credit cards, lines of credit, equipment financing) than personal credit.
- **Separation from Personal Credit**: Uses your EIN and D-U-N-S Number, not your SSN, protecting personal credit scores.
- **Multiple Businesses**: Each EIN (e.g., for a coaching business, virtual assistant side hustle) can build its own credit profile.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for full-time entrepreneurs or side hustlers (e.g., project managers with a resume-writing business).
- **Diverse Options**: Includes net-30 vendor accounts, fleet cards, revolving credit cards, term loans, microloans, and more.

## Step 1: Understand Tier 1 and Tier 2 Accounts
1. **Tier 1 Accounts**:
   - Entry-level accounts with minimal approval criteria (e.g., no revenue requirements, soft or no credit inquiries).
   - Ideal for new businesses or those with limited credit history.
   - Examples: Murphy USA, WEX (fleet/gas cards).
   - Purpose: Establish initial trade lines to build a Paydex score and business credit profile.
2. **Tier 2 Accounts**:
   - Require 3–4 established Tier 1 accounts and stronger business credibility (e.g., consistent trade lines, business email/domain).
   - May involve hard credit inquiries but offer revolving credit or higher limits.
   - Examples: U.S. Bank, OfficeMax, Lowe’s.
   - Purpose: Scale credit limits and diversify trade lines for a robust credit profile.
3. **Strategy**: Start with Tier 1 accounts to build a foundation, then progress to Tier 2 accounts after 3–6 months of consistent payments and trade line reporting.

## Step 2: Apply for Tier 1 Accounts

## Step 3: Build Tier 1 Trade Lines
1. **Establish 3–4 Trade Lines**: Use Murphy USA and WEX accounts consistently for 3–6 months to report at least 3–4 trade lines to D&B. A trade line is a record of payment history reported to a credit bureau.
2. **Maintain Payment Discipline**: Pay invoices early or on time to boost your Paydex score (D&B’s primary business credit score, ideally 80+ for strong credit).
3. **Track Progress**: Use an Excel spreadsheet to log:
   - Purchase dates and amounts.
   - Payment due dates and confirmation of payments.
   - Trade line reporting status (check via D&B’s CreditSignal or paid reports).
4. **Avoid Common Mistake**: Don’t overuse these accounts or miss payments, as this can harm your Paydex score and delay Tier 2 eligibility.

## Step 4: Apply for Tier 2 Accounts

   - Choose account types (net-15, net-30, revolving) based on your cash flow and repayment ability.
   - Use these accounts for business expenses that drive growth (e.g., marketing for online coaches, equipment for landscapers).

## Step 5: Optimize Business Credit Building
1. **Leverage Trade Lines**: Each account adds trade lines to your D&B profile, strengthening your Paydex score. Aim for 5–10 total trade lines across Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts within 6–12 months.
2. **Focus on D&B**: Prioritize accounts reporting to D&B, as it’s the largest and most widely checked business credit bureau. A Paydex score of 80+ signals strong creditworthiness to lenders.

4. **Monitor Credit Reports**: Check your D&B, Business Equifax, and Business Experian reports regularly (via paid services like D&B CreditSignal or Nav) to ensure accurate trade line reporting.
5. **Scale to Tier 3**: After 6–12 months of consistent payments and 5–10 trade lines, apply for Tier 3 accounts (e.g., American Express Business Gold, Chase Ink Business) to access higher credit limits ($50,000+).

- **Avoid Common Mistakes**:
  - Don’t apply for Tier 2 accounts without 3–4 Tier 1 trade lines, as denials can harm your credit profile.
  - Avoid using personal credit or cash for business expenses; leverage these accounts to preserve personal finances.
