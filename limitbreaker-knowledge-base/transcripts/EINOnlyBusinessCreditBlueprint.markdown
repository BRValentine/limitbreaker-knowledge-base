# EIN-Only Business Credit Blueprint: Step-by-Step Guide to Building Business Credit Fast Without a Personal Guarantee

This blueprint provides a comprehensive, actionable strategy for building business credit quickly using EIN-only, no personal guarantee (PG) accounts, based on the provided transcript. Designed for users of the Limitbreaker credit maxing bot, this guide helps small business owners establish a robust business credit profile with tier 1 and tier 2 vendor accounts and secure high-limit, EIN-only business credit cards like the Revenued Flex Line Plus Business Card (up to $250,000). By following these steps, you can access working capital, protect personal assets, and scale your business without relying on personal credit.

## Why EIN-Only Business Credit Matters
Building business credit without a personal guarantee offers significant advantages:
- **Protects Personal Assets**: No PG means creditors cannot pursue your personal finances if the business defaults.
- **Higher Credit Limits**: Business credit accounts often provide 3-5x higher limits than personal credit cards.
- **Scalable Funding**: Establish trade lines to qualify for larger financing options (e.g., SBA loans, venture capital) to grow your business.
- **Credit Flexibility**: EIN-only accounts rely on business revenue and activity, not personal FICO scores, making them accessible even with poor personal credit.

This blueprint focuses on tier 1 and tier 2 vendor accounts to build a strong business credit profile and culminates with a no-PG business credit card for substantial working capital.

## Step-by-Step Blueprint to Build EIN-Only Business Credit

### Step 1: Set Up Your Business for Credit Eligibility
Ensure your business meets the basic requirements for tier 1 and tier 2 vendor accounts.

1. **Establish a U.S.-Based Business Entity**:
   - Form an LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp, or partnership through your state’s Secretary of State website (cost: $50-$200).
   - Obtain a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS (free at irs.gov).
   - **Action**: File your business entity and secure an EIN. Use Limitbreaker to store and track these details.

2. **Obtain a Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Number**:
   - Apply for a free DUNS number at dnb.com to establish a business credit profile.
   - **Action**: Register for a DUNS number and monitor your Paydex score via the Nav app (free version).

3. **Open a Dedicated Business Checking Account**:
   - Set up a business checking account with at least 6 months of consistent activity (e.g., deposits, payments).
   - Why? Lenders and vendors verify business activity through bank transactions.
   - **Action**: Open a business checking account at a credit union (e.g., Navy Federal) or bank. Ensure regular deposits to show activity.

4. **Ensure Business Stability**:
   - Operate for at least 90 days (some tier 1 vendors may waive this).
   - Maintain no derogatory business reporting (e.g., delinquencies) on your D&B profile.
   - **Action**: Use Limitbreaker to check your D&B report for inaccuracies and dispute any errors.

**Pro Tip**: Ensure your business name, EIN, address, and phone number are consistent across all platforms (e.g., D&B, bank accounts, vendor applications) to avoid red flags.
