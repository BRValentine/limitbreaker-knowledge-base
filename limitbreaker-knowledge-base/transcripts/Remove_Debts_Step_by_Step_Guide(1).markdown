# Step-by-Step Guide to Permanently Remove Debts from Credit Reports Using the Medical Debt Loophole

This guide provides a detailed process to remove adverse accounts (closed accounts, charge-offs, or collections) from your credit reports by leveraging a legal loophole related to medical debts, as outlined in the provided transcript. The process uses a federal law to support your disputes. Follow these steps carefully to maximize success.

## Prerequisites
- Access to your credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.
- A printer and highlighter (optional, for physical organization).
- An Excel spreadsheet or similar tool to track disputes and complaints.
- Patience and persistence, as the process may require multiple attempts over weeks or months.

## Step 1: Obtain Your Credit Reports
1. **Access Reports**: Obtain your credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Options include:
   - Visit [experian.com](https://www.experian.com) and pay for all three reports with FICO scores for a comprehensive view.
   - Use free services like [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) for basic reports (may not include FICO scores).
   - Request free annual reports from each bureau (via mail or if denied credit), though these may not include FICO scores.
2. **Download and Review**: Download PDF versions of your credit reports. Print them if preferred, and use a highlighter to mark adverse accounts (closed accounts, charge-offs, or collections).

## Step 2: Identify Eligible Accounts
1. **Understand Adverse Accounts**: Adverse accounts are closed accounts, charge-offs, or collections negatively impacting your credit score.
2. **Target Medical-Related Accounts**: Identify accounts that may be related to medical expenses, including:
   - Direct medical bills (e.g., hospital, ambulance, dentist, chiropractor, or prescription medication bills).
   - Credit card accounts (e.g., Capital One, Bank of America) used to pay for medical expenses, even partially. Examples include payments for dentistry, oral surgery, therapy, aftercare, or family members’ medical care.
3. **Focus on Closed Accounts Only**: Do **not** attempt this process for open or revolving accounts with late payments. Only closed accounts, charge-offs, or collections qualify.

## Step 3: Draft Dispute Letters
1. **Prepare Letters**: Write one dispute letter for each credit bureau (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). Each letter should:
   - Identify the specific adverse account(s) you want removed.
   - State that the account(s) are medical-related and must be removed under federal law.
   - Include the following line for each debt:  
     **"The following debt(s) MUST be removed as per federal law since each of them related to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Regulation V, Senate Bill 5480."**
   - Demand removal without needing to prove the debt’s medical nature (e.g., no receipts required).
2. **Use Templates**: If available, use free credit letter templates from the source (check the video’s description box for links).
3. **Keep Copies**: Save copies of all letters for your records.

## Step 4: Send Dispute Letters
1. **Mail Letters**: Send one letter to each credit bureau (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) via certified mail for tracking.
2. **Wait for Response**: Allow 30 days for the bureaus to respond. They may:
   - Remove the account(s).
   - Request proof (unlikely, as they are overwhelmed with disputes).
   - Deny the dispute.

## Step 5: Repeat Disputes if Necessary
1. **Resend Letters**: If the accounts are not removed, resend the same dispute letter every 30 days, up to three times.
2. **Track Progress**: Use an Excel spreadsheet to log:
   - Dates letters were sent.
   - Which bureaus were contacted.
   - Responses received.
3. **Monitor Changes**: Check your credit reports after each dispute to see if accounts are removed.

## Step 6: Escalate with Complaints
1. **File Complaints**: If accounts remain after three disputes, escalate by filing complaints against each bureau:
   - **State Attorney General**: File a complaint with the attorney general’s office in the state of each bureau.
   - **Federal Government**: File a complaint online with the appropriate federal agency (refer to the video’s description box for the exact website).
2. **Document Everything**: Keep records of all complaints, including dates and confirmation numbers.
3. **Follow Through**: Persistent complaints may pressure bureaus to remove the accounts.

## Step 7: Monitor and Persist
1. **Check Progress**: Regularly review your credit reports to track improvements.
2. **Be Persistent**: Understand that not all accounts may be removed immediately. Continue disputing and filing complaints as needed.
3. **Expect Gradual Results**: Some accounts may be removed after one dispute, while others may require escalation. Success rates vary, but persistence increases your chances.

## Tips for Success
- **Stay Organized**: Use an Excel spreadsheet to track all actions (letters sent, complaints filed, responses received).
- **Be Proactive**: Consistently follow up every 30 days and escalate when necessary.
- **Avoid Open Accounts**: Do not attempt this process for open or revolving accounts, as it will not work.
- **Consult an Attorney**: If unsure about the legality or process, consult a credit attorney for confirmation.

## Important Notes
- **Legal Basis**: The loophole leverages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Regulation V, Senate Bill 5480 (effective March, approximately 2022), which prohibits medical-related debts from appearing on credit reports. This includes direct medical bills and credit card debts used for medical expenses.
- **No Guarantees**: Not all accounts may be removed, but persistence improves outcomes.
- **Patience Required**: The process may take weeks or months, similar to long-term efforts like fitness or debt repayment.

By following these steps diligently and citing the specified law, you can potentially remove adverse medical-related accounts from your credit reports, improving your FICO score and creditworthiness.
