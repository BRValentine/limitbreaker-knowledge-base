## Why Tier 1 Vendor & Net Accounts Matter
Tier 1 vendor and net accounts are the foundation for building business credit, offering significant advantages:
- **No Personal Credit Check**: Approvals based on business EIN, not personal FICO, ideal for those with scores below 600.
- **No Revenue Requirement**: Accessible for new businesses (30+ days) with zero revenue.
- **Fast Credit Building**: Establishes trade lines and a Paydex score within 30-90 days, reported to business bureaus (D&B, Experian Business).
- **Scalable Funding**: Lays the groundwork for tier 2 accounts, business credit cards, and tier 3 financing (e.g., SBA loans).
- **Practical Use**: Provides access to supplies (e.g., office, cleaning, equipment) for business operations or community support.

This blueprint outlines how to secure and use tier 1 accounts to build a robust business credit profile.

## Step-by-Step Blueprint to Build Business Credit with Tier 1 Accounts

### Step 1: Set Up Your Business for Credit Eligibility
Ensure your business meets the basic requirements for tier 1 vendor accounts.

1. **Establish a Business Entity**:
   - Form an LLC, S-Corp, or sole proprietorship via your state’s Secretary of State website ($50-$200).
   - Obtain an EIN from irs.gov (free).
   - **Action**: File your business entity and secure an EIN. Store details in Limitbreaker’s secure vault.

2. **Get a DUNS Number**:
   - Apply for a free DUNS number at dnb.com to establish a business credit profile.
   - **Action**: Register for a DUNS number and monitor via Nav’s free version.

3. **Open a Business Checking Account**:
   - Set up a dedicated business checking account at a bank or credit union (e.g., Bank of America, Navy Federal).
   - **Action**: Deposit $50-$100 to show activity. Track account details in Limitbreaker.

4. **Verify Business Fundability**:
   - Ensure consistent business name, EIN, address, and phone number across all platforms (e.g., D&B, bank, vendors).
   - Operate for 30+ days (some vendors may not require this).
   - **Action**: Use Limitbreaker to audit business details for consistency and flag discrepancies.

**Pro Tip**: Businesses <5 years old are considered “new” by lenders, making tier 1 accounts ideal for startups or side hustles.

### Step 2: Secure Tier 1 Vendor/Net Accounts
Apply for tier 1 accounts to establish trade lines without personal credit checks or revenue requirements.

1. **Understand Tier 1 Accounts**:
   - **Definition**: Vendor accounts (net 5, net 7, net 10, net 30) that extend credit for business supplies, reporting to business credit bureaus (D&B, Experian, Equifax).
   - **Features**:
     - No personal credit check or guarantee.
     - No revenue or time-in-business requirements (some may require 30-90 days).
     - Net terms: Pay within 5-30 days after receiving goods (e.g., cleaning supplies, office equipment).
   - **Benefits**:
     - Builds trade lines and a Paydex score (80+ with timely payments).
     - Provides usable supplies for business or community (e.g., schools, shelters).
     - Limits from $500-$10,000 based on vendor approval.
   - **Action**: Review transcript’s description for a list of 10 tier 1 vendors (to be provided by the creator).

2. **Recommended Tier 1 Vendors**:
   - **Granger**: Industrial supplies, net 30, reports to D&B.
   - **Quill**: Office supplies, net 30, reports to D&B.
   - **Uline**: Shipping/packaging supplies, net 30, reports to D&B.
   - **Business T-Shirt Club**: Custom apparel, net terms, reports to bureaus.
   - **Crown Office Supplies**: Office products, net terms, reports to bureaus.
   - **Sumo Office Supplies**: Office supplies, net terms, reports to bureaus.
   - **Nav Business Boost**: Credit monitoring and reporting, net terms, reports to bureaus.
   - **Wise Business Plans**: Business plan services, net terms, reports to bureaus.
   - **WEX/Murphy USA (Fleet Cards)**: Gas cards, net terms, reports to bureaus, no personal credit check.
   - **Capital One Spark Classic**: Business credit card, net terms, reports to bureaus (may require minimal personal credit).
   - **Action**: Apply for 4-5 vendors via their websites, selecting “invoice me” at checkout. Use Limitbreaker to track applications and net terms.

3. **Application Process**:
   - Visit vendor websites and order $50-$100 worth of supplies (e.g., cleaning supplies, office chairs, printers).
   - Choose “invoice me” to activate net terms (net 5, net 7, net 10, or net 30).
   - Confirm the vendor reports to business credit bureaus (call or check website FAQs).
   - **Action**: Place orders and verify reporting status with vendors. Store invoices in Limitbreaker.

**Pro Tip**: Pay invoices early (e.g., within 5-10 days for net 30) to boost your Paydex score. Never default, as business credit disputes are harder than personal credit.

### Step 3: Use Tier 1 Accounts Strategically
Maximize the utility of vendor accounts to benefit your business and community while building credit.

1. **Order Useful Supplies**:
   - Purchase items like hand sanitizers, trash bags, sump pumps, or printers for business operations or real estate investments.
   - Donate excess supplies to schools, YMCAs, shelters, or churches to support the community and reduce inventory costs.
   - **Action**: Identify business or community needs (e.g., office supplies for teachers) and order via vendor accounts. Track purchases in Limitbreaker.

2. **Pay Invoices Promptly**:
   - Pay within 5-10 days (not the full net term) to optimize Paydex scoring, which rewards early payments.
   - Use business checking account funds or personal funds if necessary, as limits are low ($50-$500 initially).
   - **Action**: Set up autopay or use Limitbreaker’s payment scheduler to ensure early payments.

3. **Leverage for Business Growth**:
   - Use supplies to cut costs (e.g., bulk discounts vs. retail at Walmart) or equip real estate properties (e.g., sump pumps, fixtures).
   - For Wise Business Plans, order a business plan to qualify for SBA loans or venture capital (tier 3/4 financing).
   - **Action**: Compare vendor prices to retail and order cost-effective items. Store business plans in Limitbreaker for funding applications.

**Pro Tip**: Think outside the box—use tier 1 accounts to solve problems (e.g., supply shortages during COVID) or support community initiatives, enhancing your business’s reputation.

### Step 4: Monitor and Build Business Credit
Establish a business credit profile and progress to tier 2 accounts.

1. **Track Trade Line Reporting**:
   - Use Nav (free version) or Limitbreaker’s credit monitoring to verify that 4+ tier 1 accounts report to D&B, Experian Business, or Equifax Business.
   - Aim for a Paydex score of 60+ (80+ ideal) with 4 accounts reporting positive payment history.
   - **Action**: Sync Limitbreaker with Nav to monitor trade lines and Paydex score in real-time.

2. **Avoid Common Pitfalls**:
   - Do not default on payments, as business credit has fewer dispute protections than personal credit.
   - Stop ordering from a vendor once it reports to bureaus (one-time reporting is sufficient).
   - Verify vendor reporting status, as only ~5% of vendors report to bureaus, and requirements may change.
   - **Action**: Call vendors to confirm current reporting policies. Use Limitbreaker to flag non-reporting vendors.

3. **Progress to Tier 2 Accounts**:
   - Once 4-5 tier 1 accounts report (30-90 days), apply for tier 2 accounts (e.g., 7-Eleven Fleet Mastercard, J.C. Penney Commercial Account from prior blueprints).
   - Requirements: 3-5 tier 1 trade lines, 6-12 months in business, minimal revenue (e.g., $10,000-$50,000).
   - **Action**: Use Limitbreaker to identify tier 2 vendors and apply after confirming tier 1 reporting.

**Pro Tip**: Build a Paydex score in as little as one day by ordering from 4 vendors simultaneously, but pace applications (e.g., one per week) if preferred.

---

### Step 5: Scale to Higher Tiers and Financing
Use your business credit profile to access larger funding options.

1. **Apply for Tier 2 Accounts**:
   - Target vendors like 7-Eleven, J.C. Penney, or Lowe’s (net 60, $2,000-$10,000 limits) to build stronger trade lines.
   - **Action**: Apply via vendor websites after tier 1 accounts report. Track applications in Limitbreaker.

2. **Pursue Tier 3 Financing**:
   - With 6-12 months of tier 1/2 trade lines and a Paydex score of 80+, apply for business credit cards (e.g., Capital One Spark Classic) or bank loans (e.g., SBA loans up to $5 million).
   - **Action**: Prepare revenue and credit reports via Limitbreaker for tier 3 applications.

3. **Explore Tier 4 Financing (Optional)**:
   - Pitch to venture capitalists or angel investors using a Wise Business Plans business plan, leveraging your credit profile.
   - **Action**: Use Limitbreaker’s funding analytics to identify investors and prepare pitches.

**Pro Tip**: Maintain a Paydex score of 80+ and 10-12 trade lines (tier 1/2) to qualify for tier 3/4 financing with favorable terms.
