### Step 3: Apply for the Credit Cards
Strategically apply for cards to leverage a single hard pull for multiple products and secure instant approvals.

1. **Application Strategy**:
   - **MGM World Mastercard**: Apply at mgmresorts.com or through Comenity Bank’s portal. No income proof required; emphasize business use if prompted.
   - **PNC Cash Unlimited**: Apply at pnc.com. Request balance transfer to a checking account post-approval for cash access.
   - **BCU Cash Rewards**: Join Baxter Credit Union (bcu.org), then apply for the card. Use TransUnion Vantage score (580+).
   - **Navy Federal Cash Rewards**: Apply at navyfederal.org after membership. Select Visa/Mastercard (not Amex) for liquidation to Go Prepaid Debit Card.
   - **SDFCU Premium Cash Card**: Apply at sdfcu.org post-membership. Highlight Experian mortgage score (check via MyFICO).
   - **Action**: Apply for 1-2 cards per bureau (e.g., MGM/PNC for Experian, Navy Federal for TransUnion, SDFCU for Experian) to minimize hard pulls. Use Limitbreaker to track applications and pull dates.

2. **Leverage Hard Pulls**:
   - Credit unions allow multiple applications (e.g., credit card, personal loan) within one hard pull (valid for 30-45 days).
   - SDFCU offers a $50,000 personal loan or line of credit with 90-day deferred first payment.
   - **Action**: After SDFCU card approval, apply for their personal loan using the same pull. Track via Limitbreaker’s loan application manager.

**Pro Tip**: Apply for Navy Federal and SDFCU cards first, as their low score thresholds (580+) and membership benefits increase approval odds.

### Step 4: Liquidate Credit for Cash
Convert credit card limits into cash for business or real estate investments.

   - Liquidate Navy Federal Cash Rewards (Visa/Mastercard) balance to a Go Prepaid Debit Card.
   - Use for real estate deposits, business expenses, or transfer to a checking account.

2. **PNC Balance Transfer**:
   - Transfer the PNC Cash Unlimited balance (15 months 0% APR) to a checking account.
   - **Action**: Initiate a balance transfer request via PNC’s portal after card approval. Track funds in Limitbreaker.

3. **SDFCU Personal Loan**:
   - Secure a $50,000 personal loan or line of credit alongside the Premium Cash Card.
   - Use for larger investments (e.g., real estate down payments).
   - **Action**: Apply for the loan post-card approval, leveraging the same hard pull. Use Limitbreaker to manage loan terms.

**Pro Tip**: Use liquidated funds strategically (e.g., real estate flips, business inventory) to generate revenue and repay cards quickly, avoiding high interest after promotional periods.
