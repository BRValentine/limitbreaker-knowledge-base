# Step-by-Step Guide to Navigate Credit Score Changes Due to New 2025 Regulations

This guide provides actionable steps to manage and mitigate the impact of major changes to credit reports and scores in 2025, as outlined in the provided transcript. These changes include the reporting of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) loans, the potential reappearance of medical debt on credit reports, the use of rent payments for mortgage qualification, and emerging trends like crypto assets and social credit scores. Follow these steps to protect and improve your credit profile.

## Prerequisites
- Access to your credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.
- An Excel spreadsheet or similar tool to track disputes and credit activities.
- Awareness of your social media activity and spending habits, as they may impact future credit evaluations.
- Patience and persistence, as credit repair and disputes may require multiple rounds.

## Step 1: Understand and Mitigate the Impact of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Loans
1. **Recognize the Risk**: Starting in fall 2025, BNPL loans will appear on credit reports, potentially lowering your credit score by reducing the average age of credit (15% of your FICO score).
2. **Limit BNPL Usage**: Avoid using BNPL for small purchases (e.g., groceries, clothes, plane tickets) unless the loan term is at least 12 months. Short-term loans (4–6 months) close quickly, negatively impacting your credit age.
3. **Prioritize Long-Term Accounts**: Maintain older credit accounts (e.g., credit cards open for 5+ years) to boost your average credit age and payment history (35% of your FICO score).
4. **Monitor Credit Reports**: Check your credit reports after fall 2025 to identify any BNPL accounts. Dispute any inaccuracies using the process in Step 4.

## Step 2: Prepare for Potential Medical Debt Reappearance
1. **Understand the Issue**: A new rule effective in 2025 aimed to permanently remove medical debt from credit reports, but a lawsuit by the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA) and others may reverse this, potentially reintroducing medical debt and lowering credit scores.
2. **Check for Medical Debt**: Review your credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion to identify any medical debt that reappears.
3. **Dispute Reappeared Debt**:
   - Draft dispute letters to each credit bureau, stating the medical debt must be removed as it violates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule (refer to Regulation V, Senate Bill 5480).
   - Cite Metro 2 compliance issues, as many accounts lack complete or accurate data (e.g., missing dates or entries).
   - Send letters via certified mail and save copies.
4. **Persist with Disputes**: If the bureau claims the debt is “verified,” dispute again. It may take 4–6 rounds to remove inaccurate or non-compliant items. Use the process in Step 4 for detailed dispute instructions.
5. **Stay Informed**: Monitor the litigation outcome (expected by mid-to-late July 2025) via the litigation tracker link in the video’s description. If medical debt returns, act quickly to dispute it.

## Step 3: Leverage Rent Payments for Mortgage Qualification
1. **Understand the Change**: As of July 7, 2025, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) allows rent payments to be considered for mortgage qualification, a significant shift to help renters qualify for homeownership.
2. **Verify Rental Payment History**: Ensure your rent payments are consistent and on time. Gather proof (e.g., lease agreements, payment receipts) to submit to lenders if needed.
3. **Check Credit Reports**: Confirm that rent payments appear correctly on your credit reports. They may be listed as “miscellaneous” or another category, as rent isn’t a standard lending product.
4. **Contact Lenders**: When applying for a mortgage, ask lenders how they incorporate rent payment history into Vantage or FICO scoring. Request clarification on reporting standards, as integration details are still evolving.
5. **Stay Updated**: Monitor updates on this policy, as implementation details will develop over time. Check reliable sources like the FHFA website or follow the video creator for further guidance.

## Step 4: Dispute Inaccurate or Harmful Credit Report Items
1. **Obtain Credit Reports**: Access your credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion via:
   - [experian.com](https://www.experian.com) (paid, includes FICO scores).
   - [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) (free, may exclude FICO scores).
   - Free annual reports from each bureau (via mail or if denied credit).
2. **Identify Issues**: Highlight BNPL loans, reappeared medical debt, or other inaccuracies (e.g., missing data, incorrect dates) that violate Metro 2 compliance standards.
3. **Draft Dispute Letters**:
   - Write one letter per bureau, listing specific accounts and errors.
   - For medical debt, cite: **“This debt must be removed as per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Regulation V, Senate Bill 5480.”**
   - For other items, note Metro 2 compliance issues (e.g., incomplete data entries).
   - Demand removal or correction of inaccurate items.
4. **Send Letters**: Mail disputes via certified mail for tracking. Save copies of all correspondence.
5. **Follow Up**: Allow 30 days for a response. If denied or “verified,” resend the dispute every 30 days (up to 4–6 rounds). Persistence is key, as no account is 100% Metro 2 compliant.
6. **Escalate if Necessary**: If disputes fail, file complaints with:
   - The state attorney general for each bureau’s location.
   - The CFPB or other federal agencies (check the video’s description for links).
   - Track complaints in an Excel spreadsheet with dates and confirmation numbers.

## Step 5: Utilize Crypto Assets for Mortgage Applications
1. **Understand the Change**: As of June 2025, the FHFA allows Bitcoin to be counted as an asset on single-family home mortgage applications without converting to US dollars.
2. **Document Crypto Holdings**: Maintain records of your Bitcoin or other crypto assets (e.g., wallet statements) to present to lenders.
3. **Explore Crypto Credit Cards**: Consider cards like the Gemini card or the upcoming American Express/Coinbase card (fall 2025) for crypto rewards, but use cautiously to avoid lowering your credit age (see Step 1).
4. **Consult Lenders**: When applying for a mortgage, confirm that your lender recognizes crypto assets per FHFA guidelines. Provide documentation as requested.

## Step 6: Protect Against Social Credit Score Risks
1. **Understand the Risk**: The government and lenders may use social media activity, bank transactions, and other data (e.g., Social Security, Medicare, student debt) to build a social credit score, potentially affecting loan eligibility or job prospects.
2. **Monitor Online Activity**: Be cautious about what you post or comment on social media, as it may flag you as a high-risk borrower or employee.
3. **Review Bank Transactions**: Regularly check your bank statements for spending patterns that could be scrutinized (e.g., excessive risky purchases).
4. **Limit Data Exposure**: Avoid sharing sensitive information online and consider using privacy-focused tools (e.g., VPNs, secure browsers).
5. **Stay Informed**: Monitor developments in social credit score policies, as they are still emerging. Check reliable sources or the video creator’s updates.

## Tips for Success
- **Stay Organized**: Use an Excel spreadsheet to track disputes, complaints, and credit activities (e.g., dates sent, responses received).
- **Be Proactive**: Regularly check your credit reports for new BNPL loans, medical debt, or rent payment entries. Dispute inaccuracies promptly.
- **Persist with Disputes**: Don’t accept “verified” responses. Continue disputing (4–6 rounds) and escalate to complaints if needed.
- **Limit New Credit**: Avoid opening multiple BNPL or short-term credit accounts to maintain a high average credit age.
- **Consult Experts**: If unsure, consult a credit repair professional or attorney to navigate complex disputes or new regulations.

## Important Notes
- **BNPL Impact**: BNPL loans can lower your credit score by reducing credit age. Use sparingly and prioritize long-term accounts.
- **Medical Debt Reversal**: The lawsuit against the CFPB’s medical debt rule (pending in Texas Eastern District Court) may reinstate medical debt on credit reports. Monitor and dispute aggressively.
- **Rent Payments**: The FHFA’s rent-to-mortgage policy is new and evolving. Ensure your rent payments are documented and inquire about lender integration.
- **Crypto Assets**: Bitcoin is now a valid asset for mortgages, but verify lender compliance. Use crypto credit cards cautiously.
- **Social Credit Scores**: Emerging data tracking may impact lending and employment. Limit risky online or spending behavior.
- **Metro 2 Compliance**: Most credit report entries have errors (e.g., missing data). Use this to your advantage in disputes.
- **Patience Required**: Credit repair and navigating new regulations take time. Expect 4–6 dispute rounds and ongoing monitoring.

By following these steps diligently, you can mitigate the negative impacts of 2025 credit changes, leverage new opportunities like rent and crypto for mortgages, and protect your credit profile from emerging risks like social credit scores.
