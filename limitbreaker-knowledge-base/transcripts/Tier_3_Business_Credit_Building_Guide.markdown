## Step 1: Verify Tier 1 and Tier 2 Foundation
1. **Confirm Trade Lines**:
   - Ensure 5–7 Tier 1 (e.g., Murphy USA, WEX) and Tier 2 (e.g., Home Depot, Staples, OfficeMax) accounts are reporting to Dun & Bradstreet, Business Equifax, and/or Business Experian.
   - Verify trade lines have been reporting for 4–5 months with consistent, on-time payments.
2. **Check Business Credit Score**:
   - Access your Paydex score (aim for 80+) via [dnb.com](https://www.dnb.com) (CreditSignal or paid reports), [nav.com](https://www.nav.com), or [experian.com/business](https://www.experian.com/business).
   - Confirm an “A” rating or equivalent on business credit reports, indicating strong payment history.
3. **Monitor Reports**:
   - Regularly check D&B, Business Equifax, and Business Experian reports to ensure accurate trade line reporting.

## Important Notes
- **Tier 3 Advantages**: Offers high-limit credit cards ($25,000–$100,000+) and loans ($100,000+) for significant business growth, relying on strong revenue and credit profiles.
- **Reporting Impact**: Cards like American Express and bank-issued cards report to Dun & Bradstreet, boosting Paydex scores. Loans may not report but enhance financial stability.
- **Revenue Requirements**: $200,000+ annual revenue and 2–5 years in business are standard, though strong Tier 1/Tier 2 credit can compensate for lower revenue.
- **Banking Relationships**: Active bank accounts with consistent balances ($5,000–$10,000 monthly) and transaction history improve loan approval odds.
- **Alternative Lenders**: Square, Kabbage, and PayPal offer accessible loans for businesses using their processing platforms, ideal for e-commerce or service businesses.
- **Expected Outcomes**: With a strong Tier 1/Tier 2 foundation, Tier 3 accounts can secure $100,000–$500,000+ in funding within 12–24 months, enabling major business expansion.
- **Avoid Common Mistakes**:
  - Don’t apply for Tier 3 without 5–7 trade lines and 4–5 months of reporting.
  - Avoid low bank balances or irregular transactions, as banks/lenders review financial stability.
  - Don’t overuse credit cards or miss loan payments, as this harms your Paydex score and future funding.

By following these steps, leveraging Tier 3 credit cards (e.g., American Express, bank-issued cards) and loans (e.g., bank loans, Square, Kabbage, PayPal), and building on a solid Tier 1/Tier 2 foundation, you can scale your business credit in 2025, unlocking significant funding for growth and long-term success.
