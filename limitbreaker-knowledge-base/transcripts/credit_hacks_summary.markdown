# Summary of "Credit Hacks to Increase Your Score FAST" for Limitbreaker Bot

This video, presented by a credit expert with an 800+ FICO score and over 20 credit cards, outlines the top five fastest strategies to boost credit scores in 2025, tested on thousands of clients. These hacks leverage credit utilization, payment history, and credit mix to achieve 50–150 point increases in 30–60 days, helping users secure better loan rates, approvals, and financial opportunities. The strategies include paying down credit cards to zero, adding secured loans, using Kovo for credit building, reporting rent with Boom, and adding authorized user tradelines strategically. The summary is tailored for the Limitbreaker Telegram bot, providing clear, interactive steps to help users implement these hacks, avoid common mistakes, and track progress toward higher credit scores.

## Key Points
- **Credit Score Impact**: High credit scores (700+) unlock low interest rates and approvals, while low scores lead to denials or high interest. These hacks can boost scores by 50–150 points in 30–60 days.
- **Hack #5: Pay Down Credit Cards to Zero**: Keep balances at $0 before the statement closing date to optimize utilization (30% of FICO score). Paying after the statement date reports balances, lowering scores and adding interest.
- **Hack #4: Add a Secured Loan**: Open a 12+ month secured loan at a credit union, pay off 90% after it posts to credit reports, and autopay the rest to boost credit mix and payment history.
- **Hack #3: Kovo Installment Loan**: Kovo’s 24-month, no-fee, 0% APR credit builder adds an installment tradeline with no hard inquiry, reporting on-time payments to all bureaus (including Innovis) for consistent score growth.
- **Hack #2: Report Rent with Boom**: Boom reports rent payments to all three bureaus without late payment risks, adding positive history. A one-time $65 fee reports up to 24 months of past rent for significant impact.
- **Hack #1: Authorized User Tradeline**: Add yourself to a credit card with 2+ years of perfect payment history, high limits ($10,000+), and no balances. Avoid American Express, as it only reports from the addition date.
- **Common Mistakes**: Paying cards after statement dates, paying off loans too early, missing credit builder payments, using Boom without verifying landlords, or adding tradelines with high utilization or new accounts.
- **Tools and Services**: Dispute Beast (AI credit repair software), Kovo, and Boom are recommended for their effectiveness and user-friendliness.

## Step-by-Step Instructions for Limitbreaker Users
The following steps are formatted for integration into the Limitbreaker bot, providing interactive guidance to help users implement the five credit hacks and boost their FICO scores.

1. **Pay Down Credit Cards to Zero**:
   - **Why**: Credit utilization (30% of FICO score) drops to 0% when balances are paid before the statement closing date, boosting scores by 20–50 points. Paying after reporting hurts scores and adds interest.
   - **Bot Prompt**: “Let’s lower your credit card utilization! Check your card’s statement closing date (call issuer or check statement). Pay balances to $0 before this date each month. Done? Reply ‘cards paid’ with the number of cards (e.g., ‘2 cards paid’). Need help finding dates? Type ‘card help’.”
   - **User Action**:
     - Call your credit card issuer or check statements to find the closing date (e.g., 15th of the month).
     - Pay all balances to $0 before this date, not after, to avoid reported balances.
     - Set calendar reminders to pay consistently each month.
   - **Bot Follow-Up**: “Cards paid to $0? Reply ‘cards paid’ with details. Expect a 20–50 point boost in 30 days. Need payment tracking tips? Type ‘payment tracker’.”

2. **Add a Secured Loan**:
   - **Why**: A 12+ month secured loan improves credit mix and payment history, adding 30–60 points when 90% is paid off after reporting and the rest is autopaid.
   - **Bot Prompt**: “Boost your credit mix! Open a 12+ month secured loan ($500–$5,000) at a credit union like Navy Federal or PenFed. Wait for it to post to your credit report (30–60 days), then pay 90% in one payment and autopay the rest. Ready? Reply ‘loan opened’ or ‘need credit union’.”
   - **User Action**:
     - Join a credit union (e.g., Navy Federal, PenFed) and apply for a secured personal loan ($500–$5,000, 12–36 months).
     - Wait for the loan to appear on your credit report (check via annualcreditreport.com).
     - Pay 90% of the balance in one lump sum (call the lender to process).
     - Set up autopay for the remaining 10% over the loan term.
     - Avoid paying off early or closing the loan to maintain score-building activity.
   - **Bot Follow-Up**: “Loan opened? Reply ‘loan opened’ with details (e.g., ‘$1,000 Navy Federal loan’). Paid 90%? Reply ‘loan paid 90%’. Need credit union suggestions? Type ‘credit union list’.”

3. **Sign Up for Kovo Credit Builder**:
   - **Why**: Kovo’s 24-month, 0% APR, no-fee installment loan adds a tradeline with no hard inquiry, reporting on-time payments to Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, and Innovis, boosting scores by 20–40 points.
   - **Bot Prompt**: “Add a credit builder with Kovo! Sign up at getkovo.com (24-month, $10/month, no hard inquiry). Set up autopay to avoid late payments. Done? Reply ‘kovo started’. Need setup help? Type ‘kovo help’.”
   - **User Action**:
     - Sign up at getkovo.com ($10/month, 24 months, instant approval).
     - Set up autopay to ensure no missed payments (Kovo never reports lates).
     - Monitor your FICO score via Kovo’s tracking tool.
     - Avoid stopping payments early to maintain the tradeline’s impact.
   - **Bot Follow-Up**: “Kovo started? Reply ‘kovo started’. Expect 20–40 point boost in 3–6 months. Need autopay setup tips? Type ‘autopay help’.”

4. **Report Rent with Boom**:
   - **Why**: Boom reports rent payments to all three bureaus without late payment risks, adding positive history (up to 24 months retroactively for $65), boosting scores by 30–60 points.
   - **Bot Prompt**: “Use your rent to build credit! Sign up with Boom at boompay.app ($25/year or $2/month). Verify your lease/landlord. Lived 2+ years? Pay $65 for 24 months of past payments. Done? Reply ‘boom started’. Need help? Type ‘boom help’.”
   - **User Action**:
     - Sign up at boompay.app ($25/year or $2/month; $65 one-time for 24 months of past rent if applicable).
     - Verify your lease and landlord to ensure reporting accuracy.
     - Link payments (Zelle, Venmo, Cash App, ACH, check) to your bank account.
     - Avoid skipping verification to ensure payments report correctly.
   - **Bot Follow-Up**: “Boom started? Reply ‘boom started’ with details (e.g., ‘$65 for 24 months’). Expect 30–60 point boost in 30–60 days. Need landlord verification tips? Type ‘landlord help’.”

5. **Add an Authorized User Tradeline**:
   - **Why**: Adding yourself to a credit card with 2+ years of perfect payment history, $10,000+ limit, and no balances boosts credit age and utilization, adding 50–100 points overnight. Avoid American Express due to limited history reporting.
   - **Bot Prompt**: “Ready for a big boost? Ask a friend/relative with a 2+ year, $10,000+ limit credit card (no balances, no lates) to add you as an authorized user. Avoid Amex. Done? Reply ‘tradeline added’. Need tradeline sources? Type ‘tradeline help’.”
   - **User Action**:
     - Ask a trusted friend or relative with a qualifying card (2+ years, $10,000+ limit, no balances/lates) to add you as an authorized user.
     - Alternatively, purchase a tradeline from tradelinesupply.com ($200–$500).
     - Avoid new cards, high-utilization cards, or Amex (reports only from addition date).
     - Confirm the tradeline reports to your credit (check annualcreditreport.com after 30 days).
   - **Bot Follow-Up**: “Tradeline added? Reply ‘tradeline added’ with details (e.g., ‘$15,000 Visa tradeline’). Expect 50–100 point boost in 30 days. Need trusted tradeline vendors
