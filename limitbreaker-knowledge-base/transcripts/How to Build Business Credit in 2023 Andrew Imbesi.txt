How to Build Business Credit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzeamkTW1mc
5:53
mean when I started um I didn't know about business credit I just simply went and got all these
5:59
personal lines of credit that's what I did too yeah yeah so tell me like what
6:06
what's kind of your guys's philosophy on credit yeah you know we we definitely work with um like a lot of people who
6:12
want to get access to money fast and they also don't want to hurt their credit score either so
6:18
obviously the best way to do that is getting business credit that doesn't report to their personal credit report
6:24
right so um you know we often don't really go through the whole like net 30 kind of
6:31
vendor card stuff um in our space like in my company just because we work with a lot of people
6:37
that want to get their hands on money quickly right so um we often just take the fast approach
6:43
of you know using personal credit score right to get approved for that you know
6:48
business credit card and you know many people may think like oh I need to use my personal credit to get the business
6:55
credit card while it's ultimately you who's you know borrowing the money so the bank's going to want to look into
7:01
you to make sure that you're going to be a you know good candidate to accept a
7:07
business credit card from them so what I mean if if you're gonna use your
7:12
personal credit to go get business credit I mean what's the point of getting business credit why not just sure get personal credit there's there's
7:18
a lot of good benefits to it because you're going to get higher limits than you would normally get on personal
7:24
credit cards you also have access to relationship managers and they could really help you get very high limits
7:31
compared to what the algorithm may give you online for a business credit card
7:36
um you know it's also something that's more so tied to your business than your personal credit report right now
7:42
obviously if you default on it you know there may be some consequences to your personal credit however if you max out a
7:49
business credit card um it's not going to affect your personal credit so
7:54
um really it's only going to affect your relationship with that bank specifically so say maybe you got a business credit
8:01
card with maybe U.S bank or something like that right but then you wanted to go get a car loan with a credit union
8:09
well if you have twenty thousand dollars maxed out on that U.S bank card it's not going to affect your ability to get a
8:14
good rate on a car loan with some credit union right so it keeps you
8:20
in a really good spot so it even though you need your personal credit to qualify
8:26
for that business credit you're saying it's not going to impact it as you utilize it that's correct yeah the
8:31
personal credit is going to be completely untouched if you're you know now there are some business credit cards
8:37
you know like discover Capital One TD Bank um now like if you Max those out you
8:44
know those often do report to personal credit score so you know normally we
8:49
stay away from those kinds of banks but most business credit cards other than
8:54
like those Banks if you Max them out you know like a thirty thousand dollar limit
9:00
your personal credit score is not going to tank which is like super important because especially if you want to get
9:05
more business credit cards I've done this with a lot of people where they've came to me and they've had a maxed out
9:11
business credit card and they question like oh well will I still get approved for more business credit cards even
9:17
though this one business credit card is maxed out and then we take a look at their personal credit they have like 770
9:22
score or something like that and they're still able to go to other Banks to get approvals for more business credit cards
9:28
because you know the bank's not exposing all too much money to this candidate
9:35
already right so um you wouldn't necessarily want to go back to the same bank that's already
9:40
exposing a lot of money to you at that current moment but you'd want to go to another bank
9:47
um where they're not necessarily going to see that when they look into your personal credit report right so when
9:52
they pull your experience they're not going to see that you have um this twenty thousand dollars of debt
9:57
if they re unless they really dig into like the Small Business Financial exchange and like those business credits
10:02
but they're really really looking mostly at your personal credit and your personal borrowing history
10:08
okay yeah because I remember when my um personal credit was super maxed out
10:16
um it was in like the 500s like yeah 11 500 yeah I know what that's like yeah
10:21
and I honestly I didn't care because I I wasn't getting a car loan I had a car
10:26
paid for in cash and I um it was like it wasn't an expensive car it's like a 10
10:32
000 car and I wasn't looking to buy rental properties or things like that because I didn't have a job I couldn't
10:38
get like you know a normal mortgage and so I was like look the next two years I'm just gonna build my business and
10:45
keep utilizing this cash over and over again and I have zero percent so I don't really care and I'm gonna just keep it
10:51
maxed out and whatever that's what I did I just didn't even try to like increase
10:56
my credit and I I knew that too I couldn't even go really increase it because I still had
11:03
the capital out you know working a real estate deal so I was kind of just like I didn't care
11:08
sure you know and and that's definitely um like an approach that's totally something I've done myself right when I
11:14
first started with like personal credit and you know I think it's definitely something that you know if if you're in
11:21
that similar situation like you and I were in where you know it didn't really matter you know I'm focused on building my business right then all the power to
11:28
actually do it but also you know to keep in mind too like say maybe you max out your cards you've kind
11:34
of reached the end of the road um it's definitely also good to have that that business credit where you know
11:39
maybe oh maybe I have to go get more business credit um or else you have to get something called like a bridge loan where you know
11:48
maybe you have someone who pays down your credit card debts for you so you could get more business credit say if
11:53
you reach like an end of the road situation where now your score's in the 500s you might not be able to get
11:59
business credit or lending products so um yeah tell me you were telling me this a
12:06
little bit earlier tell me about Bridge loans yeah because I you know we hear about Bridge loans for Real Estate sure
12:13
you were telling me like bridge loan for these credit guys is really interesting it is pretty interesting yeah so
12:21
um a friend of mine uh Curtis actually introduced me to this idea of bridge loans and
12:28
um when I was getting into the funding space um I only knew like a little bit about it and he was explaining to me how it
12:35
was going to help obviously me bring on more people that I can help get funding for which I thought that was a great
12:41
idea because I wanted to help more people with this right it's something that's obviously benefited both you and
12:47
I you know we both are huge Advocates of credit and think it's you know super powerful when starting a business so you
12:53
know being able to help more people is super important to me as well so the thing about Bridge Loan basically
13:00
what it is is that say someone has maybe thirty thousand dollars of credit card
13:05
debt that's keeping their score maybe around like low to mid 600s maybe even 500s right
13:12
um they have like no late payments or you know derogatory marks things like that you know someone like that can actually
13:19
still get approved for business credit cards however they actually need to pay down their their credit card debt first
13:25
right because the bank's going to pull their credit they're going to say oh well this person has
13:31
um too high of balances amongst his revolving trade lines and they're just going to turn you down so if you could
13:37
find an actual person this is not a debt consolidation loan but if you could find an actual person who has money available
13:44
to lend to you to pay down your cards this is going to boost your score up and
13:49
you could actually get approved for more credit and this makes sense to do really on
13:55
your personal credit cards you can do it with business credit cards to get more business credit cards with the same bank
14:01
right so maybe you have a maxed out Chase card and you want to get another Chase card but you can't pay down that
14:07
Max down Chase Card well Chase isn't going to expose more credit until you pay down your existing debt that you owe
14:14
to them so you can find a bridge loan lender who has money available in their
14:20
checking account to temporarily lend to you so you could pay down that card allow the statement to come around apply
14:27
for another card and then you know you could then pay back the lender using credit cards so to recap this it's
14:35
basically like uh to your point it's a bridge on short term like uh you know I'll make this
14:41
simple so everyone can understand like I let's just say I have 30k of credit maxed out
14:48
um well actually I'll use you you have 30k of credit maxed out I have Capital as a lender and my Capital could have
14:56
came from credit too yeah uh it could come from cash credit whatever right and I say hey I'm gonna make this agreement
15:02
with you I'm gonna pay off your 30 grand of credit cards okay for the next couple of weeks while your credit score adjusts
15:09
to that payment your credit's gonna go up and then you're going to be able to apply for
15:15
you know business lines and other things now they have a good score and then once those are approved you're then going to
15:22
pay me back yeah with credit yeah that's exactly correct got it
15:28
that is a I I've never heard that one but I mean the to me it's like there's always just
15:35
ways to like utilize money and debt and and you know help accomplish people or
15:41
help people accomplish their goals but I would imagine me as the lender I'd want a pretty big
15:48
amount because I'm kind of taking a risk that dude yeah what happens if you don't pay me back yeah no that's totally a
15:54
risk to consider right I mean you know I've I've definitely seen you know some instances of that but normally you run
16:01
into to good people I mean genuinely people are often really good people out there and as long as you set the
16:07
expectations right and you know you're very strong on kind of like that initial call just as a contract too yeah the
16:14
contract right before engaging in the business in the service right you're qualifying that person making sure that
16:20
they're a good fit to lend to right um that's all very important
16:26
um but yeah it often is a pretty high fee uh associated with it however is
16:32
ultimately like a bridge for you to get to you know that greater outcome right because maybe say in your case right you
16:39
made twenty five thousand fifteen thousand from your first flips right but say maybe you weren't able to get
16:46
approved for business credit right maybe your score already was pretty low and you had maxed out cards but you just
16:51
found you know flipping houses right so you know you get a bridge loan and then
16:57
you get approved for that 50 000 right and now you're you know smooth sailing right so that fee almost you know if
17:05
you're going to be able to accomplish that kind of result right what does that fee really matter because
17:10
now look at the amount of success that yeah you know 100 yeah I mean like I've said this all the time with hard money
17:15
lenders and other things like you know people um when I was first getting in the industry they were like dude you can't
17:22
pay hard money lenders these guys are Loan Sharks they're they're gonna charge you crazy interest and points and all
17:29
this stuff I was like yeah I mean it kind of is what it is
17:34
um yeah it is what it is well for me I'm just like it's a cost of doing business exactly with even the the credit cards
17:41
what happened was I had zero percent interest for like 12 18 months on just varying cards and even after the 18
17:48
months I still kept them maxed out even though I was paying 20 yeah because I
17:53
was like well I'm still making a lot more so like what do I care and um you know I think like with this
18:00
it's an interesting thing because to me you just run the analysis of like okay
18:06
well how much am I gonna get approved for by doing this right so it's like all right I owe 30 you know
18:14
or uo30 and let's just say I was gonna let you go borrow my 30 grand it's high
18:20
risk for me and I'm like bro you're going to pay me five grand to do this yeah right and
18:26
you know you you go out there and you apply for these things now that your credit's good and you go get you know I
18:33
don't know 50 100 Grand of credit it's like dude I would happily pay five grand
18:39
to go sure access to another 50 or 100 because I know I can make a lot more
18:44
than five grand yeah yeah no totally no you bring up a really good point there for sure and then I know you also
18:51
mentioned a little bit about kind of repercussions things like that I mean you know ultimately in the worst case
18:57
scenarios obviously never want to get to that point it could get to the point of you know like small claims courts it
19:03
could get you know into like nasty legal stuff it could get you know collection agencies after borrowers right you
19:11
always want to avoid those situations but um that's like kind of the risk associated with the lender is you know
19:16
when am I going to get my money back yeah how long would it take for somebody to typically get their money back in that scenario you know in those
19:23
scenarios it could it could be a very long time um which is a long time
19:29
could be a couple of months uh well I guess walk me through like what's the typical time frame for somebody to go
19:36
pay down there yeah in like the worst case scenario
19:42
right like that's how long it could take but typically Bridge loans last no
19:47
longer than maybe two three four five weeks so it takes a month for you know
19:53
because you're gonna have your payment or whatever reporting coming up right exactly so I'm gonna pay that thing
19:58
before reporting yeah and it's going to report that you've paid it off yeah it's at that
20:04
point the lender can ask for their money back right confidently safely right so there should like right in a perfect
20:10
world there should be no issue having that repayment right and what how would they pay him back they would just charge
20:16
the card to like plastic or something um you know they could just charge the cards through a payment processor so the
20:22
lender can have a payment processor so a lot of people don't have that yeah yeah I know a lot of people don't have that
20:28
however it can be easily set up with you know stripe you know payment processors
20:34
which I would describe you for 35 Grand yeah yeah and it just go right back on
20:39
your personal credit yeah exactly and now the borrower you know say they had
20:45
all this debt on personal credit at 20 interest you know now they're paying it
20:51
back at zero percent so they've even saved some money there because maybe they were paying 20 per year on thirty
20:59
thousand dollars right that's about five thousand six thousand per year right and
21:05
you know now you just did this bridge loan to go get approved for more zero percent cards you move all the balances
21:10
to the zero percent cards now you've actually saved yourself you know you're gonna pay the the lender right but
21:17
you've also now moved it to zero percent cards too right no I I've honestly I've heard a lot of
21:26
tricks and trades of credit and that that's one that I never thought of and
21:31
I'm like yeah dude if the borrower was right I would totally be a lender for that that's yeah some good passive income
21:37
well yeah no exactly yeah no it like and that's very important too it's just screening your borrowers making sure
21:44
that they're a good fit um before you know lending them money so that way you could avoid any kind of
21:49
trouble with repayment right it's obviously something you have to acknowledge and be wary of when you're
21:55
engaging in that kind of business but oftentimes it's pretty smooth as long as you're actually lending to the right
22:01
people um I've done this with maybe over 100 people at this point and it's gone very
22:06
smooth maybe like one or two bad eggs I've seen but you know pretty consistently I've seen you know really
22:14
good really really really good outcomes as long as you know the screening process goes very well yeah I like that
22:21
idea so what I'm curious too about with business credit or just llc's like how
22:27
long do you have to have an LLC and all that very good I mean typically it's best to have one open for couple of
22:33
months however there's nothing stopping you from getting approved for business credit even with the business that's
22:39
open you know for like one day in fact actually one of my top success stories
22:45
inside my my own funding program um he actually got approved for 228 000
22:51
of zero percent interest business credit on an LLC that was not even like two
22:58
weeks old right so he had you know joined my program you know May 30th and
23:04
by you know June 21st all without starting with an LLC he had 228 thousand dollars
23:11
of available credit right yeah so however it's it's definitely going to be a factor for the people who have you
23:18
know like lower credit scores um who don't have the best credit profile if they're
23:24
giving the bank more reasons to say no they're you know gonna give the bank more reasons to say no right but you
23:30
know if you have really really good credit and you're giving the bank very minimal reasons to say no with a brand
23:36
new business you know you can still get approved for what are the reasons Banks say no
23:42
you know there's there's tons of reasons it's going to be based on you know all the credit factors that you know add up
23:48
to what make your credit score right maybe it could be something with having a late payment or maybe some kind of um
23:53
internal kind of uh thing that happened in the past maybe you had you know a
23:59
charge off with the bank um it could be you know too high of credit card utilization right those are some basic
24:06
ones but some other ones that people might not you know think of are maybe you've opened up too many recent you
24:12
know credit cards right maybe also you know you've yeah opened too many accounts maybe you have too new of a
24:19
business sometimes that's usually in the case of you know tougher Biz like you
24:24

25:09
again wealthyinvestor.com apply for a call today right how how much of a
25:14
difference does it make for like your how high your credit score
25:19
is versus like your actual income yeah very good question I mean more so
25:26
they are going to look at personal credit you know revolving trade lines that's another thing too like if you're
25:32
looking for an increase this is why it's like really important to like make sure your personal credit is good at the same
25:37
time you know wanting to get high approvals for business credit cards because the bank will look for
25:43
comparable trade lines on your personal credit so they'll look to see like you
25:49
know what kind of credit limits other banks have already approved you for on your personal credit so
25:55
you know that's definitely like important to you but back to like the income aspect of things you know income's certainly going to matter it'll
26:02
certainly help you get a higher limit on a card but um they're really going to
26:07
look at that personal credit borrowing history you could have you could be making 500 000 a year but if you have
26:13
like a 550 like depends they don't like they're not gonna like so dumb that like a broke person with 700 is better I know
26:20
it it's very it's very interesting I've definitely seen a lot of cases where someone's making sixty thousand dollars
26:26
a year with a 800 credit score get approved for more money than someone who makes four times the amount than they
26:33
make in a year yeah I think they're getting more credit than the money they make and then the guy who actually makes a lot of money is not getting anything I
26:40
know it's it's crazy how it works yeah yeah that's crazy uh I I know this too
26:46
so I remember early on in my career I was applying for business credit for my
26:51
house slipping company and every time the bank would do it they'd be like so what do you do I'm like I'm it's a house whipping business and they did not like
26:58
that yeah now that's like super important too that's definitely something I run into a lot with people is they have this idea of what they want
27:05
to use the funding for however they also have to you know talk about the lower
27:13
risk activities in which they're engaging in with their business because you know some of the things that you're
27:18
doing besides just you know investing and flipping is um you're also doing you know management you're also providing
27:24
like other services like within your business right and you want to be able to go to the bank and have a really good
27:30
story straight so that way you're not throwing yourself under the bus by saying something high risk and then they
27:35
turn you away I've seen a couple of people where they have some kind of you know very like risky kind of crypto
27:42
Forex website online yeah yeah I got a super 4X crazy weapon yeah yeah and
27:49
they've yeah the bank just turned them around they said yeah we can't take you on as a client so I've definitely seen
27:56
that it's not fun when that happens but um that's why it's like so important to have a really strong story going into
28:03
the bank um that way you don't throw yourself under the bus you know yeah typically like I'll go in
28:10
there and say I'm a consultant right which I am I'm a consultant right but if I'm going in there talking about like
28:15
credit things like that they may like that they may not like that right so you know I might as well stick with
28:21
something a lot more see a consultant is a much better business than saying hey oh yeah get more credit oh yeah I help
28:27
people figure out how to you know mess up your system yeah yeah you know
28:33
you'd be surprised though a lot of a lot of relationship managers actually they know what you're doing well because they
28:38
do they're they're making a ton well yeah yeah you know the real it's that's why it's so good again in touch with the
28:44
relationship manager versus applying for things through the algorithm because um with them they actually make money by
28:52
giving you a card the more that you spend on that credit card the more money the bank makes so the bank doesn't want
28:59
to lend to someone who's gonna max out a card and then yeah not churn through it
29:04
right spend and pay it back spend and pay it back that's what the credit card is for right but when you're holding on
29:10
like sure they want you to use zero percent they do want you to spend money on it they do want you to carry a balance a little bit but they also don't
29:16
want you to be you know out all this money and not churning through the card you know the it's not just what's in it
29:23
for you know that relationship manager but what's in it for the bank too because they're going to make money based on you spending on the card you
29:31
know through those back end processing fees and you know they also make money when you bring your checking account
29:36
over when you get into their other products things like that so they really really especially you know and it's a
29:42
little bit weird times right now with what just happened last week but the bank really wants your business and will
29:49
attract do with a zero percent offer hmm yeah do you have any idea how these relationship managers get paid like I
29:56
mean I know well they got like a base they get like a salary but they get bonuses on you know the amount of spend
30:03
that is generated on the card They also make money um not just on the spend but also like
30:09
you know how many clients they're bringing into their ecosystem um so those are like some some major
30:15
ways they do have like some you know kind of sales commission incentive but you know they also get paid obviously a
30:21
salary too um okay so let's talk about this this whole
30:26
banking thing you just mentioned it um you know I don't know when this episode's gonna get released but you
30:33
know recently Silicon Valley Bank just went under yeah like they uh
30:40
you know what's crazy to me is I I'm watching the bank and just the story
30:45
develop and I remember seeing it on like Friday or something and they're like yeah Peter thiel's telling everyone to
30:52
remove their money from Silicon Valley Bank and I'm like wow that's kind of like heartless you know like yeah this
30:59
bank has helped a ton of startup Founders they've been around for like 40 years and you know a lot of Peter
31:05
thiel's Investments I'm sure in that bank right and then yeah you know like a day later they're
31:11
basically like yeah Silicon Valley Bank's going under like yeah they're they're on a bank run and they're toast
31:18
and then the next day they're like dude what's gonna happen to all these depositors 98 of them don't have FDIC
31:24
insurance and you know the next day they're like all right everyone's gonna be made whole and it was like the
31:31
fastest developing thing ever but I'm just like dude I mean this bank was like
31:37
40 years old having like 90 billion dollars of deposits and they got hit
31:43
with a bank run and then yeah Signature Bank ends up getting going under and then I was reading something about
31:49
Credit Suisse today or whatever it's called and I'm just like what the heck is going on in the world yeah it is
31:55
pretty crazy I mean you know nothing stays the same forever right so you know always got to be on your toes you know
32:02
really just you know keep your money safe right you know I mean the FDIC insurance is really you know very
32:09
powerful thing to have especially too but um but yeah no it's definitely a crazy
32:15
situation that's happening right now yeah I mean what do you think is going to happen I guess in your
32:21
industry right because sure I've thought about this a lot with um recessions right sure
32:27
it starts to become harder to get access to money no that's totally right yeah I mean that's where you know it's very
32:33
important too especially like right now you know say if there's someone out there watching this like who has things
32:40
like wrong with their credit maybe they have a late payment a derogatory Mark right it's like super important to get
32:45
that you know fixed because even during like the recession it's kind of crazy what starts happening right like you
32:51
know people are losing their jobs but also people want to start businesses there's always people who want to start businesses right but it obviously is
32:58
going to become harder to get access to credit right and you know you know the
33:04
banks are still going to give out credit you know they may not give as much or they may not you know kind of they may
33:12
tighten like their circle of people that they would lend money to you know maybe someone who would have gotten approved
33:18
with uh like a low 700 score maybe that threshold increases to a higher credit
33:24
score right um however yeah that's why it's like super important just keep all you know your
33:30
ducks in a row just make sure that your credit is really is what as good as what can be take care of it because if you
33:36
are in that situation where you need to get approved you know you're going to want to make sure that you know your
33:42
credit is in order you know to get that approval when the time comes right yeah
33:47
no 100 like I I think um you gotta always be prepared like you're
33:52
saying I think that um things are going to get harder credit wise to get I mean uh how have you seen
34:00
you know you've been doing it now for over two years um the industry changed since when covid
34:06
when you get into it yeah in the middle of covid when money is being handed out like hotcakes yeah and then now it's
34:13
different yeah no it's I mean the banks are still lending a lot of money right now I mean even now like you know it
34:20
seems like every Monday like one of my relationship managers sends me all these like new approvals from the weekend you
34:26
know they're still looking to bring on new new clients especially with the frenzy I know I've talked to a couple of
34:31
Bankers like the past couple of days and they're like oh yeah I've just been super busy with you know all the
34:37
craziness that's going on like bringing on new clients like talking to new people you know all of that
34:43
um but yeah no it is is going to be very interesting um it's just going to tighten up but I
34:49
wouldn't say it's going to be completely like non-existent you know people are still going to be able to get approved
34:55
but it's definitely going to be you know a little bit tougher you know just as the example before
35:00
so what would be your tips to somebody who is
35:06
um looking at getting more credit or some tips they can take yeah I mean you
35:11
know I think and especially with what we mentioned just now too it's like having relationship managers is going to be
35:16
like super super important because you know they're going to help you get approved than what you would be able to
35:22
get on your own through the algorithm right right and so what I mean when you do that how do you get a relationship
35:28
manager and like instead of just applying on freaking whatever website yeah a lot of it is just really like
35:35
simple communication right and you know you know a lot of these relationship
35:40
managers you know they're not they they bounce around from Branch to Branch sometimes you know they're not even
35:47
available like in a branch you know you have to kind of go up the chain a little bit to get to them and sometimes they're
35:53
really hard to get in touch with because they're only going to work with businesses that do over one or two
35:59
million dollars a year right so you know it's not always so easy for someone to
36:04
just call into the bank and ask for one of these relationship managers especially if they have a brand new business because you know they're gonna
36:12
the the teller or whoever's there is gonna you know go follow protocol and keep them exclusive to the businesses
36:19
that are producing a lot of Revenue um you know which you know through a lot of you know trial and error a lot of
36:25
calling things like that you could eventually find really cool Bankers like people I've been able to meet who are
36:31
willing to help people who are just starting out too right 100 percent yeah because I um I mean I
36:38
know this game is like all about relationships right and so everything that I've ever accomplished has never
36:44
been just freaking yeah on your own thing and it's good success Trump comes
36:49
through people exactly yeah so you're you're just in constant communication with these relationship managers
36:55
um is is like American Express still just like the best limits
37:01
that's a good question I mean they I'm like forever grateful for American Express personally because they
37:07
definitely helped me get my start um those were like the credit cards that I used
37:13
um when I started my business but yeah they do and you know sometimes it could be a little challenging because I have
37:19
seen people that just get you know straight up 2K when they just start um if they like apply through the
37:24
algorithm while other people you know can get 25 um you know thirty five thousand dollars
37:30
I've seen other Banks be able to get give way higher amounts way bigger
37:35
approvals um but Amex is still really really great card company
37:41
um you know it is you know and those relationship managers as well are harder to get in touch with because everything
37:47
they do is online there's no physical branches I mean oftentimes when you call you're speaking to someone in a
37:53
different country or in a customer service role so um I've had a couple of people actually
37:58
inside my group who've referred me some American Express Representatives is that they've been able to work with
38:04
themselves so they're hard to work with we have them um at American Express and so that's
38:10
like the main thing we've been getting for our businesses but it's just like dude even just doing it it's like the
38:16
communication is just super bad yeah well I mean they're they're pretty
38:21
algorithmic I mean you just apply for like they just have everything set up
38:26
for you to like apply online like instant decisions right right and you know that's why it's good to you know
38:32
kind of understand like how credit Works especially as a business owner and be resourceful as a business owner to be
38:39
able to expand outside of just Amex alone right to be able to get into other banks that you may have not heard of
38:44
right right but what's your thoughts on like these small Banks now because everybody's scared of the small banks
38:50
with the runs on yeah Silicon Valley yeah I mean you know you obviously want to make sure that you know you're
38:57
you know covering your bases with an FDIC insured account sure I mean that's like I'm just simple yes getting credit
39:04
credit from these small Banks yeah very good question I mean because you know say like that bank closes your credit
39:09
line can close right so it's always good to have options right just because you have one business credit card doesn't
39:15
mean that that's enough right it's good to have a couple of credit cards right you know some with some big Banks some
39:22
with some some small Banks too right right so you know it's good to have options because if something like that
39:27
happens with Silicon Valley bank and now oh man this this was my primary credit line that I was using you know now
39:34
you're back to square one and you know maybe you have to you know start applying for more credit cards maybe you
39:40
also need a bridge loan yeah you know something like that right so it's good to have options I mean I know a lot of
39:46
people that don't like to have too many credit cards but it's good to have like maybe a handful or two yeah yeah I've
39:53
seen some people with like 50 60 70 credit cards like yeah yeah that's what it's like for me
40:00
I've I think I've have now ah nearly like 30 credit cards I've gotten over the last two years so you
40:06
should have brought them dude yeah they're in my car yeah so I I know this is changing all the
40:14
time but what's like your current favorite credit card like because I know it's just there's different offers I
40:21
really do like I really do like the AmEx card right now but this one the gold card okay you know well that's that's
40:27
not zero percent either but we have it I don't even know dude it's so funny I gotta well you answer that I'll say this
40:33
sure like one of my guys is all about points and like yeah all these things he's like bro you gotta do this this and
40:39
this I'm like bro I don't have time for this like freaking he's like well I can refer you to the um this guy he like can
40:46
you can go be first class to wherever I'm like I would rather just go make more money like I'm not gonna deal with
40:53
freaking yeah yeah trying to figure this thing out and so when they apply for our business cards they're all like gold or
40:59
platinum and I'm like yeah I have no idea the difference of why I use one or the other I I couldn't tell you what its
41:04
bonuses are or anything sure yeah I like using the gold card a lot because uh you
41:10
know for me personally I spend a lot of money on YouTube advertising okay so you
41:15
know I get four times points on every dollar I spend for YouTube advertising so if I'm spending you know 100 000 plus
41:21
a month I'm getting 400 000 points that's like eight round trips back to New Jersey right so I could go and see
41:28
my family for free whenever I want yeah dude honestly I don't even know what we do with our points yeah oh they might
41:35
just be sitting there I know I know some other people in our space that just have points sitting one of my one of my
41:40
mentors showed me like four and a half million Amex points he's like I haven't used these and I don't know how long I'm
41:46
like man you could fly like your whole team on a trip instead of you know using uh you could save some some cash I guess
41:53
right but yeah you can use all those points to you know like that's 4.5 million points it's like
42:01
I think that's equivalent to like 45 000 of plane tickets that's a lot of
42:06
that's a good that's a that's good for a whole team yeah my thing with the points
42:11
has always been like people use them for flights and stuff and I've always just taken the cash back
42:18
and I'm just like I don't really understand the difference yeah yeah I mean it's to each their own right
42:24
um you know like I I like cash back cards a lot I don't really go for points cards all so much unless it's for a
42:31
purpose right right so I mean even with the scenario you talked about earlier
42:36
with uh you know sure I'm paying interest on a card which most people hate paying interest right but if you're
42:42
making money like does it really matter if you're getting a greater return on investment by paying that interest
42:47
anyway yeah right well I'm gonna tell the team to start using um the Gold Card Gold Card on our point because that's
42:53
the best for ad spend yeah is it better than the Platinum well the Platinum you
42:59
know I mean to be honest like I have like a little bias like maybe I have my own I have my
43:04
own opinions about the platinum card I think it's a little bit of a waste to be honest I mean I think there's some valuable things with it like the Dell
43:10
credit and you know maybe indeed credit and Adobe credit all these different things that you can get with the
43:16
platinum card um but you know it doesn't really
43:22
you know attack kind of like those main spend categories right like you know
43:27
who's gonna spend like you know like not everyone but you know if you're spending like you get five times points on travel
43:35
right not everyone who's a business owner is just going to be spending on like flights all day they're going to be
43:41
spending on Advertising they're going to be spending on softwares they might be taking clients out to restaurants right
43:48
you know things where you could actually get better points um you know business software stuff like
43:53
that where the gold card like rewards you for those things like spend money on the gold card but use like the Platinum
44:00
for all the the luxury kind of you know like Centurion Lounge things you know
44:05
you could get your annual fee back by you know investing into like Dell you know that's why I got myself like a
44:12
printer using like the Dell credit right so you know that you invest in Adele and you can wait oh like yeah yeah like you
44:19
get four hundred dollars of Dell credit right like Dell like computer company uh-huh right like an Epson printer or
44:26
like yeah no I didn't know yeah so I got like an Epson printer
44:32
um on dell.com right actually I forgot about this um epson's actually uh sponsoring us now so
44:41
shout out to Epson oh that's cool yeah they're getting us like a big printer thing
44:47
I don't really know what we're gonna do with it I think it can make us like banners and all these cool songs for
44:52
business and well that's going to be cool for maybe your uh your upcoming event in Hollywood right exactly so
44:58
we're going to be using that stuff for wealthcon and then I think they're printing us like 500 shirts or something like it's gonna it's gonna be a cool
45:04
thing but like they actually sent it to us the other day of like this giant Epson printer yeah it's cool yeah
45:12
but you're saying back to credit cards I could just go by Dell and then get my
45:18
what's those your annual fee it's like 500 bucks or something so yeah like 600 700 bucks I think it's 6.95 now okay
45:25
that's crazy yeah like I remember every card I used to get was always free there's no annual yeah yeah no I think
45:33
it's crazy for the platinum card I think that because there's like really no benefit for like spend categories right
45:40
um like five times points on I don't know why I have Platinum but I do yeah and it's what I use the most there's no
45:46
Rhyme or Reason yeah yeah well I mean you could get one and a half points on
45:52
you know on on purchases over five thousand dollars but you could then instead get
45:58
like you know there's other cards out there like Chase Premiere where you could get two and a half percent cash
46:03
back on purchases over five thousand dollars really that's yeah two and a half percent is the most I've ever heard
46:08
yeah I think it's up to a certain amount I don't often get that card for everyone because a lot of people want zero
46:14
percent they're just starting out but right you know that's for like you know Big Spenders right so
46:19
um you know U.S bank has a similar option with their their leverage card two percent cash back on all your
46:26
purchases right so I mean that's gonna my first card ever that like when this was back when I was broke I was 21 and
46:33
it's like I guess I should apply for a credit card I'm an adult now and
46:38
I I was just looking it up on my own and I was like okay what's the best cash back I don't care about all these
46:44
freaking points and stuff I just want money yeah and at that time like one
46:49
percent was like the standard and then there was this card called the Fidelity card and that was
46:56
two two dollars back and I was like wow this thing's crazy so I applied for it
47:02
got it I had to open up a Fidelity account for it to work and all that and like I've literally had that car for
47:08
like 12 years yeah yeah yeah no I mean well I'm 24 so yeah
47:14
I've only had a crap my oldest credit card I think is like six years old something like that yeah it's like this
47:20
Bank of America card that's crazy yeah I uh I'm I'm like now thinking I'm like
47:27
dude how many points do we have I'm just like are you gonna go check I'm looking but I also I think our CFO is
47:35
like taking over all the stuff so I don't even I don't even know yeah
47:42
but yeah what's up you know what I I'll tell you one of the things that
47:47
always made me super mad was uh I could never get approved for a
47:53
Chase card yeah you know they have very interesting kind of you know underwriting system
47:58
right so that's why it's you know really good to have a relationship manager for for like a business card especially I
48:05
mean they could do a little bit with personal cards but they're not going to do much with the personal cards the
48:11
relationship managers they're focused on working with businesses um helping them get business lending
48:17
products helping them with you know different business products right and business credit cards are just one
48:23
product of many things that they offer and yeah just back to that point you
48:29
know like getting approved for for Chase cards you know you know there's obviously people out there that talk about like 524 rule
48:36
things like that but if you know what is that basically if you if you are approved for more than five personal
48:42
credit cards in the last 24 months they're pretty much just gonna shut their doors on you and say you can't get
48:47
anything from us right now so if you know a relationship manager however they could help you get around
48:53
that you know too much new credit in the last however many months reasoning why
48:59
you would get denied right which is what the 524 rule is just for them right not every bank has that but that is a reason
49:06
why people get denied for credit cards is that they've opened up too many credit cards recently right right that
49:12
was a that was the reason I was denied for a credit card like a couple of months ago I opened like seven personal
49:17
cards like a year ago and it was like seven months since I opened them and I tried applying for a
49:23
card I got denied and then you know I did like some some little tricks of you know showing spend on other cards and
49:30
you know opening up a checking account and then I wound up getting approved for 35 000 like you know like a month later hmm
49:37
so I guess my question is uh and we were kind of talking about this
49:43
little offline but like okay these people that come to you and they get um all this credit like the main thing
49:50
is for me anyways you better have like a reason to use it yeah because what's the
49:55
point of just starting the clock on zero percent if you don't even know what the heck you're gonna do with it no totally
50:00
no totally right and that's definitely something I run into a lot and there's like so many business models that we
50:05
were talking about offline other than you know just like normally what people see online like real estate or like
50:11
crypto or e-commerce or YouTube I mean you were even suggesting like go give you know your zero percent interest
50:17
credit to a poker player right it's uh I think that's player staking yeah poker players staking out here in Las Vegas
50:24
right yeah well no what made me think of that was uh because you were saying people will lend it to like these
50:32
traders to trade for them oh yeah and I was like well yeah I mean you could if you trusted that person but you know
50:39
it's like in Vegas so many of these um poker players they take you know they sell basically like a portion of um yeah
50:46
what they could win it's like okay you know what you're gonna buy me in and if I if I win you'll get percent 30 yeah
50:54
right and if I lose which poker's obviously very risky yeah then you know we get nothing yeah but yep yeah I mean
51:02
that's a lot of what business really is like putting confidence into the right vehicle putting confidence into yourself
51:07
knowing you're making the right decision so um that's I think what a lot of people are really looking for when they ask
51:14
themselves well what do I do with the money right it's just really finding vehicles and I mean I'm a big believer
51:21
you know just having been in business a long time now that like I mean you're either doing one of two
51:27
things in my opinion one you're gonna go use it to start your own business like sure hey I'm gonna go fund you know the
51:35
expenses of this business I'm starting I'm gonna go buy inventory I'm gonna go buy equipment and you know spend some
51:42
money on ads and and everything else right and you know it's gonna be trial by air hopefully yeah you know we end up
51:50
getting something that works and all that stuff right or to me um I think
51:55
real estate is the way I mean man the more access you have to Capital and real estate the better it is and um
52:02
we're always looking for more money in real estate yeah I think that just whatever means that is private money
52:08
business credit personal credit I don't really care just just get more Capital because we know if we're good Real
52:15
Estate Investors um it's just simply a game of debt you know the best Real Estate Investors are
52:20
great at finding deals and operating but they're also equally great at finding ways to get more money yeah
52:28
yeah totally yeah so I mean speaking of business I mean you just started this business a couple of years ago and I
52:35
mean like you said at 24 years old on the path to doing eight figures potentially
52:41
um how the heck did you learn how to like just do all the other parts right like because credit is just right great I I
52:48
learned the skill of how to get people more credit and help them and everything but you gotta know how to run the
52:55
business of hiring people Marketing sales yeah no those are all like major
53:01
components in the business I think one of the most important skills totally starts with communication right being
53:08
able to communicate for all those different things like the messaging in your marketing the messaging in your sales right you know communicating with
53:15
potential employees right it's definitely an important aspect you know to start with but I think I learned a
53:22
lot of it just from having really good mentors early on you know when I first started no I got burned on a couple bag courses
53:30
right and then eventually ran into someone I knew who would be a good Mentor for me and you know leverage zero
53:37
percent interest credit to you know kind of move myself further along in the process and you know get access to
53:45
mentorship to learn sales to learn marketing those things and um having some experience in the space
53:51
as a you know High ticket closer myself working with other coaching companies
53:56
really seeing the ins and outs of how they worked um you know like being affiliated with
54:03
some people who've ran organizations with people like Grant Cardone right so
54:08
you know being able to see like that org board being able to see you know all those different things and be able to
54:14
learn from really good people you know I think it really really helped me be able to establish my business set
54:20
up the systems properly in the beginning so now where you know in November we had maybe like myself my guy Paul my brother
54:28
Joe and a VA now we've went from having a team of like the four of us to over 20
54:34
people and just maybe like three months four months what's uh what's the future look like
54:41
like what are the goals yeah I mean I want to keep adding more people into the machine I think I had like a realization
54:47
in November you know I was doing this for myself right and I was just doing it on the small scale of you know I was
54:54
doing all the sales I was doing all the marketing um I was doing all the Fulfillment right and I had to kind of think to myself
55:01
like well you know obviously this is so great for me but I see how great it is for other
55:06
people and like how many people do I really want to reach and I had to kind of break those limiting beliefs in
55:12
myself and realize you know other people are capable and able of doing a lot of the responsibilities that I'm currently
55:19
doing myself and you know really just focusing on delegating those tasks to
55:24
other people I mean this is totally relevant even in the real estate space along your journey right to where you
55:31
know delegating a lot of that work and learning how to do that and like writing down like everything that you're doing
55:36
and handing it off to another person is such a valuable skill and such a valuable tool in your business because
55:42
once you really nail that you can just keep doing it keep adding more people to the machine and then you know now you're
55:49
kind of you know one business that's running itself you could start another business right another business after
55:54
that so that's a lot of the things I think I'm looking toward doing is you know really building my funding program
56:01
is great and as large large as it can be but also starting you know new Ventures New Opportunities maybe it could be
56:07
something in real estate that's definitely something I'm looking a lot more into or maybe something in regards
56:13
to like online marketing right or different kinds of projects that it seems like you've gotten involved with
56:19
after you know getting involved with you know couch flipping real estate right so
56:25
yeah I love it just a entrepreneur at heart and yeah I'll say this you know
56:30
once you develop the skills to do marketing at a high level and sales at a high level and hire people and manage
56:37
teams and and all that you know yeah you're right for for many things if you're staying kind of in the
56:43
same like uh in this in this case the digital space um changing out the product is not that
56:50
difficult you know it's like yeah there's a different deliverable now and
56:55
you know there's different nuances to it but overall it's it's a very similar business yeah just having like those
57:02
systems knowing what those systems are you know like learning how to you know develop an organization you know with
57:09
different divisions and different responsibilities per division um I mean I think having that
57:15
information to really start really helped me kind of go from you know where it was for me just kind of running this
57:22
is some smaller kind of you know one-man job with you know a couple of friends
57:27
helping me out to now we got like this organization that I think we were very
57:32
prepared for just given the prior experience and training and people I'd met along the way to show me introduced
57:39
me to this stuff yeah so on this uh next Endeavor for you I mean
57:47
obviously you're you got a long ways to go still just continue to grow this this business and everything else and you're
57:54
gonna scale that to wherever you know you see fit um on the investment side what are you
57:59
