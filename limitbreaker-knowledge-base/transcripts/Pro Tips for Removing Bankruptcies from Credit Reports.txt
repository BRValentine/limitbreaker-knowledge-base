0:03
the single most damaging thing that can
0:05
appear on your credit report but it's
0:07
not a death sentence that's why today
0:10
I'm going to share my secrets to
0:12
removing bankruptcies so you better
0:14
stick
0:16
around my name is Daniel Rosen and
0:19
welcome to credit repair business
0:23
secrets in the 20 years since releasing
The Impact of Bankruptcies
0:25
my first credit repair software I have
0:28
helped thousands of businesses scale
0:30
from the ground up I've also seen a lot
0:32
of people deal with bankruptcies and
0:35
I've seen how disruptive it can be to
0:37
their lives and to their credit if you
0:39
have a bankruptcy on your credit report
0:41
it's almost always going to result in an
0:43
automatic know from lenders employers or
0:46
even landlords but a bankruptcy doesn't
0:49
mean you're a bad person no it usually
0:52
just means that you went through a tough
0:54
time maybe you lost your job or had a
0:57
Health crisis or even got divorced
1:00
anything that caused a huge change in
1:02
your finances here's how this relates to
1:05
us bankruptcy is a legal process that
1:08
allows individuals or businesses to
1:11
eliminate restructure and repay their
1:14
debts under the protection of a court
1:17
the impact of a personal bankruptcy
1:19
depends on what your credit was like
1:22
before you filed the higher your credit
1:24
score was the further it'll fall and
1:27
depending on the type of bankruptcy they
1:29
can stay stay on your credit report for
1:31
7 to 10 years here's a thing to remember
Public Records and Credit Reporting
1:35
whenever there's a bankruptcy on a
1:36
credit report a great first step is to
1:39
talk to a consumer law attorney or an FC
1:43
attorney send them the report have them
1:46
review it and get feedback on it what a
1:48
lot of people don't tell you is that
1:50
there are ways to dispute bankruptcies
1:53
and even have them remove from your
1:55
credit report you see bankruptcies are
1:58
filed with the courts not with the
2:01
credit bureaus so that means they are
2:03
public records the courts don't actually
2:06
send these public records to the credit
2:08
bureaus no the credit bureaus purchase
2:11
this information from companies like
2:13
Pacer and Lexus Nexus that's right most
2:17
people don't realize that public records
2:20
aren't reported to your credit report by
2:22
the courts no the credit bureaus are
2:25
actually going out and Gathering these
2:27
records on their own and I I don't think
2:30
that's very fair here's why this is
2:32
important when the credit bureaus
2:35
receive public records from Lexus Nexus
2:38
they don't list the actual Furniture the
2:41
furniture of information is usually
2:43
noted as something like the recorder of
2:46
deeds or Municipal Court which is not
2:49
truly the actual Furniture so this is a
2:52
case of false reporting which is in
2:54
direct violation of the Fair Credit
2:56
Reporting Act and a perfect reason to
2:59
remove any public record here's what you
Step-by-Step Guide on Removing Bankruptcies
3:02
need to know as always you should always
3:05
start the credit repair process by
3:07
disputing any incorrect or outdated
3:10
information on your credit report if
3:12
that doesn't work you need to be
3:14
diligent and make sure the bureaus are
3:17
following the
3:18
FC spoiler alert we already know they're
3:22
probably violating the false reporting
3:24
part after you dispute the incorrect or
3:26
outdated information you want to follow
3:29
these simple Steps step one get access
3:33
to your info in Pacer which is a public
3:36
records database that companies like
3:38
Lexus Nexus use to gather our data
3:41
anyone can access these records for free
3:44
you just need to sign up for an account
3:46
step two request a consumer disclosure
3:50
report from Lexus Nexus thanks to the
3:52
Fair Credit Reporting Act they're
3:54
required to provide you with a copy for
3:56
free step three once you have the p
4:00
account records and the Lexus Nexus
4:02
consumer disclosure account you want to
4:05
look through both and compare the
4:06
information if you find any
4:09
inconsistencies dispute them with Lexus
4:11
Nexus just like you would with any
4:13
credit bureau they follow the very same
4:16
rules step four dispute the bankruptcy
4:19
with the credit bureaus and you do this
4:21
just like you would any other item if
4:24
the bureau verifies the information then
4:26
move on to the next step step five send
4:30
a letter to the clerk of the court where
4:32
you originally filed the bankruptcy
4:34
there's no need to get into specifics
4:36
just tell them that you disputed the
4:38
bankruptcy with the three major credit
4:40
bureaus and those credit bureaus
4:43
confirmed that the record was verified
4:45
by the court and to please provide the
4:48
Court's procedure for verifying records
4:51
with credit bureaus I've even made it
4:53
really easy for you by giving you the
4:56
exact letter you need just download my

5:04
SLU
5:06
dc- dispute and I'm also going to put
5:09
that link over in the show notes now
5:10
here's a pro tip when you send this
5:13
letter to the clerk of the court send
5:15
along a self-address stamped envelope to
5:18
make it really really easy for them to
5:21
respond but here's the thing the clerk
5:23
of the court will usually respond with a
5:25
letter explaining that they don't report
5:28
to the credit bureau
5:30
and that's what you want step six make a
5:33
copy of this letter that you received
5:35
from the clerk and send it to the credit
5:37
bureaus along with a demand for deletion
5:40
all you need to say is that you've
5:42
disputed the bankruptcy with them and
5:44
they verified the item is accurate
5:46
stating that they verified the
5:48
information with the court be sure to
5:51
have the public record name and the
5:53
reference number and then let the
5:56
bureaus know that you contacted the
5:58
court and you're providing their
6:00
response detail that the court does not
6:03
report to any credit bureau therefore
6:05
their initial response verifying the
6:08
item with the court was either an error
6:10
or a lie either way the reporting
6:13
requirements do not comply with FC and
6:17
the information must be deleted
6:19
immediately and then drop the mic it's
6:22
all about finding what's wrong on the
6:23
account and then trying to get the
6:25
bureaus to verify wrong information so
6:28
the name of the name is leverage who has
6:32
the most leverage when you have leverage
6:34
you have more power the bureaus know the
6:37
law and they understand that they have a
6:39
potential violation if they don't remove
6:41
it so they'll typically respond with a
6:44
deletion if the bankruptcy is deleted
6:46
you'll soon be able to qualify for loans
6:49
and lines of credit without dealing with
6:51
the predatory High interest rates that
6:53
keep people with bad credit Stuck In The
6:56
NeverEnding cycle of debt if the bureaus
6:59
refuse to delete the bankruptcy despite
7:01
your valid reason it's now time to file
7:03
a complaint with the cfpb because you
7:07
have a valid reason for removal and
7:09
you're entitled to fair and accurate
7:11
reporting and here's a bonus Pro tip
Bonus Pro Tip
7:14
after you dispute a bankruptcy with a
7:16
credit bureau and they take it off
7:19
sometimes the charges that cause you to
7:21
file for bankruptcy in the first place
7:23
they pop back on the report so take it
7:25
upon yourself to try to get those off by
7:28
saying they were included in the
7:29
bankruptcy that you asked to take off
7:32
the credit bureaus are usually pretty
7:34
fair about working with you to get that
7:36
kind of stuff updated just make sure you
7:38
keep all documentation and make sure you
7:40
cross all your te's and Dot your eyes

7:56
to put that link over there in the show
7:57
notes and here's my final point
My Final Point
8:00
bankruptcy may be the single most
8:02
damaging item that can appear on a
8:03
credit report but what most people don't
8:06
tell you is that they can be disputed
8:08
and even removed so whatever you do
8:11
don't give up disputing of bankruptcy
8:14
may not be the fastest process but
8:17
success is a major step to financial
8:19
recovery so it's always worth the effort
