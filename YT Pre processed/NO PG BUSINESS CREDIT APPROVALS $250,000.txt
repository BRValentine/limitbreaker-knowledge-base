coming hey welcome to Get Business Credit YouTube channel can you guys hear me okay can you guys put in the chat
section uh a one if you guys can hear me
okay hang on one second guys um I'll get into it in a second i just want to make sure the audio is okay can you guys uh
Okay is the audio too loud or echo or
anything okay good all right just want to make
sure all right sorry the live is a bit late i expected to start it like an hour
over an hour ago but had a couple technical issues here with my uh new
studio and cameras and new screens because I moved anyways um so this live isn't
going to be very long considering how late it is uh but I
just want to show you guys some one some uh recent approvals literally in the last like couple days one of my students
got but if you guys have any questions put it in the comment section live chat section and I will be sure to answer
those questions so as you guys can see here on the screen this is a new student
that signed up i think it was a week ago he signed up and he did the 16week
mentorship um and I just want to tell you guys ahead of time this is not the
standard results or what to expect if you were to possibly join my uh one-on-one
mentorship but this can happen it does happen I would say 10 to 20% of the the
time with my students so if your revenue is healthy you can get approved
for credit lines like this um if you're pre-revenue or you don't have a whole
lot of revenue coming in then you can still get approvals it's just you're not going to
get 120,000 right out of the gate so um I just wanted to show you
that this was just um last he So he has two businesses
right and they're seasonal businesses he actually got approved for two DBY lines one for each one one was like 20,000 and
then this one was 120,000 so he got this last week last
Friday and I'll show you in the client portal this is also just the one client
just the one client funding provided 30,000 this was a
um was it rant no it's um fuel manard so
this 30,000 Just like I
have mine is I have too many you
guys so that's this one right is it the right camera okay yeah this one so I
have two cameras you guys so that's this one right um he got $30,000 approval you
can see here offer summary this is just yesterday June
4th or today actually yeah today uh yesterday for me but offer summary
calculations based on uh your initial draw approved limit of
30,000 smile paid off entirely no mis
payments it's 30,000 that's the maximum that for this card that they offer right
0% APR now it is like a net 30 but if
you get approved for some of their other um cards such as say the core pay card
right or the BP Business
Solutions and they have a couple other ones as well that I have but you can
potentially use if you were to get say two or three of those right
you can use one to pay another not saying you should do that but you
can so this is uh fine if you are say pre-revenue or
you don't have a whole lot of revenue coming in you can still get this this is 100% based on your business credit
experian business credit in particular and Lexus Nexus that's the main things
that they look at if your business credit's too weak then they could possibly do um a hard pull on
your Experian uh personal credit that's why it's important and imperative to
build up your Experian business credit profile um and make sure that you have
the rich filmographic data on the actual Experian report like
I'm showing here you need to make sure you have key personnel and more than one name if
possible so if it's your wife or your husband or you have a secretary or
assistant then you want to put that and there's you can put secretary or office manager but the more information you
provide to Experian the higher chances that you're going to get approved with underwriters especially in particular
financial underwriters so not just that but um
just think of it this way if you're an OPG underwriter such as Debbie or
um RAMP any of those right it's completely no personal
guarantee so if they're giving potentially going to give you 50,000 or
like John my new student got 120,000 they want to make sure
that it's a legitimate company because unfortunately back during COVID there
was a lot of fraud going on where people were starting
LLC's putting 5,000 or 10,000 in their business bank account and then going and
applying for these Finex and they would get approved for sometimes four to eight
times what's in their business bank account then they would just basically liquidate or use that credit line and
then never pay it back and never have any intention to pay it back so things have tightened up uh these Fentin that's
why a lot of them unless your business and personal credit is very strong even though it's no personal guarantee it's
why a lot of them won't give you automated approval you connect with Plaid do the whole application and then
you're going to get uh email saying that they're going to
review the application right and that's what they're doing is they're going to actually manually look at what's on
your business credit report in particular the key personnel some of them have automated where it's already
you know gets a decision on the back end however a lot of the nog ones the fintex
they're manually going to look at see if the rich filmographic data is complete
because experian is not going to have the rich filmographic data such as the key personnel and
Um this isn't showing it but I have to show it on another one but like your business website your business phone
number a lot of that is lacking because Lexus Nexus is the one that actually provides Experian with new businesses uh
registrations through the states so they just basically provide the business name
business address and that's really it it doesn't show anything else like uh sales or
um usually the phone number is not even there because if you look up your business registration especially if it's
a LLC with whatever state that you're registered in most of the time it's very vague information it's only showing
basically the business name and business address and doesn't really show much of anything else
so that's how the Experian BIN number business identification number is
created so on the
Experian businesscredit advantage website um
smartbusreports.com it allows you to submit sorry guys I'm looking at both
screens in the comments um but it allows you to actually submit an update to
update this rich filmographic data including this sick codes the net codes if you're in a high-risisk risk
industry you want to pick a sub industry
such as like if you're in transportation right transportation is very high risk right
so instead of just being in the transportation sit code on the net code
you can get lower risk by changing it to
like narrowing it down say medical transportation or medical supply
transportation
wait till
I Yeah see this guy uh these people so I'm going to address
this here shortly um the person that keeps on commenting
right is dash office supply okay I'll show you guys here shortly
um just because I called out the company for not being legitimate now there's
like slandering my name and everything making all these like YouTube accounts and I can show you
guys some other things about the owner of Dash Office Supply that's how I took down the video and I don't want to uh do
business with somebody that has uh moral and integrity and ethic problems right
so anyways u that's a whole another video I'll be making here soon to let you guys know but any of you guys that
are in like uh watch that video before about Dash
Office Supply if you're doing business with them pay the invoice that if they sent
you product pay the invoice right but after that cancel and don't do business
with them all right i'm just warning you guys ahead of time so
um anyways back to what I was saying so
as you can see here like I saying the rich demographic data that's very important what I was saying is like the
SI code and the net code you want to fine-tune it to a lowrisk industry if
you're in a high-risk industry so there's sub industry codes
that are lower risk and I can advise on that if even if you're not joining my
mentorship if I don't accept you you can still email me support vanhorn.com or
text me 9374239954 and I don't mind looking something up for you and uh helping you
with that you know as long as it doesn't take too much of my time of course
so like I said um the rich filmographic data is very important and I'll show
that on another video um I'm going to be making a standalone Experian video okay
so you can see that probably going to release it tomorrow hopefully i have a couple videos releasing
tomorrow okay so let's just go over this real
quick so you guys understand business credit scores do not matter whatsoever so I don't want you guys getting hung up
on business credit scores so like your Experian business credit score that's the Intel score it goes from zero to 100
and zero being the worst 100 being the best don't get hung up on scores my
biggest approvals were when it was considered poor or low and that's like
say I think I was 37 when I got approved for six figure credit line
what matters more is the financial stability risk rating and that goes from
uh one to five five being the worst so you want to be at one or two
ideally and then there's this uh small business financial exchange risk rating same thing with that but this is mainly
your um like business credit cards through major financial institutions such as
like American Express Wells Fargo Bank of America and that's going to be affected
basically on your utilization and so if you have the business credit cards and you have like a lot of debt on them then
that's going to affect your small business uh financial exchange rate risk
rating so and this is actually why a lot of people aren't getting approved for
business credit lines if you're a new business and you don't have the quarterly payment trend like if you
don't see this the paid uh payment trend summary and then the quarterly payment
trend then that's going to be a major reason why you're not going to get approved for even say Sam's Club
business master card or any of them um so you really want to see this and the
only way you're going to get that is if you get some trade lines and they have to be the right trade lines as well
so you're going to see like here the payment experiences this is financial trades and then the small business
financial exchange trades and then as well as trade line
experiences so this is going to be say your um what do you call it the AT&T
T-Mobile anything communication it's going to show the supplier category um not just that it could be
anything it could even be say Dell or web bank credit line um but most of the
time it's going to say like business services or it's going to say um retail trade general merchandise
office supply packaging those are the most common ones and then there's of course
additional trade line experiences kind of a rule of thumb if you're a new business owner and you don't have trade
lines you want to get on Experian in particular you want to get three to five
so you can get NAV uh the NAV boost that counts as one business service e-credible and fair
figure so that's going to get you three right out of the gate u but that's going
to be business services so then you need some other ones as well so you could get Uline
and I'm not big into what everybody else preaches about getting these starter vendors avoid a lot of those starter
vendors um a lot of them don't even report actually so you're wasting your
money and business credit is not federally regulated therefore you have a lot of people promoting these affiliate
things where you know you're you're paying $70 for a box of big pens that
you can buy on Amazon for $10 you know
so you know avoid that if you any company you guys are unsure
of if you know it's going to help you build your business credit just text me
or email me and I'll you know let you know if you know I'm okay with that company
because there's some I don't want to name drop too many but you know there's like Suma Office Supplies Strategic
Network Solutions those don't report anymore um and you can't even
self-report those yet they're still being pushed they haven't for like four
years been reported so don't waste your money on these membership fees and these signup fees like don't do it it's you're
literally wasting your money but back to what I wanted to show you because I don't want this life to be too
long but you can see here you know this student he got
30,000 this one yeah granger's fine uh Madden Granger's fine um and Gr uh
Madden if you see why I'm doing this live because the comments are over in
the other um screen so that's why I keep on looking over so I can look at the
comments but Madden if you can do me a favor any of those uh there's been like
four accounts already like George Jennings and Ashworth and Lesie lesie is actually the
uh wife of Dan at Dash Office Supply but Madden
any of those crappy comments that coming in can you please like ban them or
whatever delete comment and ban because it's all one person and I have email I
can show you guys I'll show you uh probably tomorrow I'm going to make a video about it just so it's uh out there
in the public but I'll show you this guy's emails like threatening
um basically just a slander threaten slander slander but anyways if uh you
can do that I'd appreciate Madden um but anyways back to what I was
saying here so the fuel master Mastercard anybody can get you're not likely going
to get 30,000 right out of the gate they typically going to approve anywhere from like 3 to 10,000 depending on your
business credit profile and what you put on the application because I actually had uh
John this client this student I had told him to put 30,000 on
or no actually I told him 20,000 and then they gave him 30,000 um so it's going to be depending
on how many vehicles you put also on the application because it ask how many
vehicles is in your fleet and what's your monthly uh spend on fuel so if you
don't spend any money on fuel right now doesn't matter if your business credit's good or established or
not if you go to apply for fuel and master card and you only put that you
have one vehicle and your fuel spend is only a,000 a month don't expect to get a
$30,000 um limit approval now what's nice about
Fuel Man I'll show you guys here in a moment let me find the other one because
I've been meaning to show you guys this because a lot of people keep on asking
me okay yeah here it is sorry guys I got like 10 inch stack
of cards
see too many cards to keep track of um and most of them are all business
there's a couple personal in there but most of them are business so as you can see
here hopefully I don't know if you guys can see or
not see how it says on the side it says fleet
that one says multi and then this one says fleet they're both master cards right they're
both fueling you're going to get issued first to
fleet and then after a couple months of on-time payments you can request for the
multi the multi can be used for anything so you can charge it on anything you
don't have to just get gas and gas only so the fleet one can only be used for gas and
gas only however there's ways to liquidate it but I only teach that to my students because I don't want the bad
apples uh ruining it for everybody else there's always like one bad apple that
ruins uh business credit lines right so if you get multiple cards
underwritten through Fleet Core which is the Fuelman underwriter if you get
multiple of them that's how you can do what I did and buy houses i bought you know not expensive houses but ones that
needed rehabbed that were you know around 22 28,000 each and rehabbed them
and then put them on section 8 but you can use one to pay another i'm not saying you should do that but you know
it was something I was testing as a guinea pig anyways so back to what I was
showing here um and I'll get to the questions in a moment so yeah this is the
$30,000 uh Fuel Man card Fuel Man Master Card
and then he got approved for the Expensify card uh and that was $81,562
and that
one one second i'll get here to show just because I want you guys to know I
actually have the approvals and cards right
so see this is the expensive ID card
twist i have way too many and I don't suggest anybody to do what I did it's just way too much to manage and keep
track of but that card's good i'm going to
make a video about the Expensify card because a lot of people recently a lot of my students are getting approved
however the Expensify won't approve you unless you
have I think five I know that was PEX i believe it's
minimum of 5,000 in your business bank account to get the Expensify card and
they typically give you anywhere from 80 to 140% of what's in your business bank
account so um then the next one that he got
approved for is the DBY 120,000 and
then the other one was row that's this one right and that one he got only
10,000 which was surprising because row usually gives high limit so in all he got 130 here
and there's 30 there so
150 yeah 150 plus 81 you know 230,000 and that's not even counting
some of the other ones that he just got applied for that already got the pre-approval so there's like one that's
like flex one they're going to give probably a high limit and then there's RAMP
so this is not the norm but this student in particular probably will get around a
million dollars in 16 weeks uh mentorship so he could have went out and
got these himself without doing the mentorship however he probably wouldn't have got as high limit and he probably
wouldn't know which ones to apply for first because it's all about s um
strategy strategic methods and timing is very important you know
so if you don't have you know a lot of funds in your business bank account you
can still get approvals and there's other ways you can say use certain credit lines to help get you other
credit lines right i just don't want to speak too many things um you know publicly on here
because then the scammers out there that are watching will abuse it and ruin it
for everybody else so um and then you can see here
um you know Experian business credit uh this one you know I've already shown
this to you guys before so I don't want to you know repeat this but you know experience constantly commenting you
know and I don't want to share too much but we're I'm working on the end of the
month or July to have an announcement with Experian But like what I've shown you guys this
is all on my client portal you know these are comments in each
task let's see here like approved for 4,000 Bob was and
then uh approved for 2500 this is a lot of synchry uh like Lowe's Sam's Club i
think this 9,000 one was Sam sam's Club this one's 10,000 by
Chris thanks Doc doc if you're just coming in too if you
didn't catch what I told Madden and you didn't see those comments there's a Dash
office supply that I don't work with anymore and he's mad that you know I won't promote and uh work with them for
several reasons but if he keeps making these fake accounts and slandering and he even
told me he was going to do this what an idiot why would you tell someone you're going to slander them just makes my lawsuit even
stronger but if you could any of those uh fake accounts that
keep coming in slandering please uh ban them but you can see Angela was approved
for 2K a lot of these are smaller ones like JC Penney uh Kico
Phillips oh you guys the other thing I wanted to tell you sorry this live isn't so formal like it usually is i'm just
like wanting to let you guys know certain things but um you guys know
the this isn't underwritten through Capital One it's the Walmart business
community card that one I was the first to release that and
like they shut down the applications after like a week or two i think they got flooded on applications just a
couple years ago but I got news on that one so they have somebody else they're
working with i just can't disclose it yet but that's something to stay tuned for so if anybody's looking for a
Walmart credit line um and you can order things online then stay tuned because that one
um I got some news about that one because they closed the applications a couple years ago
so let's see here you can see approved for five approved for 10 four 3500 2500
10 so this is going to be the more the norm if you're say pre-revenue or low
revenue and I accept you to join my 101 business credit mentorship if I accept
you then these are more the common limits that you're going to get for each
credit line because a lot of the students I would say like 80% of my students they're are either pre-revenue
or not that much revenue because they're new businesses that's why they're they
you know want to build their business credit so you can see like 50,000 Best Buy
5,000 um John got approved for 100,000 that was Debbie uh John got approved for
75,000 that was revenues now those two really huge ones there that's also a
e-commerce uh student of mine he has a lot of revenue coming in so that's why he has that but I would say if you're
you don't have you know six figures or 50,000 or higher coming in gross
deposits per month then you're doesn't matter if you join the mentorship or not you're probably
going to get anywhere from say 4,000 to you know 20 30,000 for each
approval now and there's so many to go after i mean I don't have you go I don't have
any of my students go after as many cards as I got because it's just too much you know it's not necessary you're
not going to use all of them however you know most of my students they get
around credit cards and working capital lines draw lines say like Headway
Capital um just different lines like
that if you combine them all I would say probably 20 to 30 that's not counting
like certain trade
lines yeah Madden um Sam's the Sam's
Club Masterard like I made the video before like a couple weeks ago it's now since
March 4th they were required it to be personally guaranteed so there is no tricks or anything around that
so it's personally guaranteed but it's not going to show up on your personal credit the inquiry might but there's
also ways around to stop that inquiry from happening so it's you know not necessarily a hard
inquiry but if you don't pay of course and you're more than six months behind
it's going to start hitting your personal credit because it's personally guaranteed so you guys don't get scared
about personally guaranteeing things i understand you don't want it showing like on your personal credit that's fine
you don't Just because it's personally guaranteed doesn't mean it's going to show on your personal credit but like
stay away from like the Capital One Spark business card that one it's like
the worst business card you could get or worse business credit card because it
reports to your personal so if you use it for $100 or $10,000 the usage is
going to show up as if it's a regular personal credit card and it's like what's the point with that still reports
but to the on the business but it also reports on your personal that's
horrible so you don't want any accounts like that so if anybody's thinking about getting the Capital One spark card
business spark card avoid that like the plague it's not even they don't even give very high limits anyway so avoid
that one and then like these are deals um they
range like 5,000 18,000 44,000 77 8 16
58 40 uh 30 79 55 10 5 10 40 30 15 these are
just total like 794,000 this is just from um four months
of my students um actual loans that's why I have to cover their
name up these are loans through uh different types they like working capital
lines or where you have to pay it back every two weeks or weekly they're kind of like
merchant cash advances but they're not drawing daily and some of them are actual credit lines where it's like six months to one
year or draw a line um this is like another partner I work
with six deals funded amount 74,000 so let's see
here uh what else was going to show you guys i'll get to the comments here in a
moment let's see here so I wanted to show you guys too you can see this is the new client
portal businesscredit.cc so
We're working on it it was supposed to be launched last month but we didn't get it launched fully yet there's still
features we're working on but we have a Android and iOS app as
you can see we have an app you can download and do your
tasks you could I prefer people to do them on desktop or laptop however things
on the fly you can do on download our app and do it on the app so stay tuned
for that there's I'll show that once we're ready to fully launch sometime this month i'll show you guys that but
let's go over the client portal if I accept you as a
student this is what you're going to see you're going to fill out this form
this is the intake form just basic business information this allows me to
do the audit on your business so I'm looking at all four major bureaus and secondary bureaus like in
Sonia i'm looking for even Lexus Nexus uh
business so I'm looking at everything as a whole making sure there's not like
mixed addresses wrong addresses you want everything matching across the board and of course the rich
filmographic data supplied i can't tell you enough like
why a lot of viewers on YouTube watch my content get denied because they don't
pass the KYC process know your client process it's as simple as not having a
business website and there's no excuses for that even not having a business website
websites don't cost very much i work with this unit company they only charge
$79 that's it and then $16.99 a month it's onetime fee so I worked out
negotiated a deal where they give a discount and it's only $79 onetime fee
they have the site up within 7 days and you pay only $16.99 a month that includes hosting um changes if you need
to make changes and uh hosting your email business
email so it's really like done for you so it you know it's a nice professional
site that they build for you as well so there's no excuses why you don't have a business website but you need to have a
business website because there's a lot of underwriters especially the no PG business credit
lines they won't approve you if you're not listed say with the Chamber of Commerce Better Business Bureau Google
Local Yellow Pages these are all free thing like it's free to do as a business owner don't do the
paid ones because like Better Business Bureau they have like a paid listing don't do that just do the free one and
verify it and it's fine but you need that because when underwriters are
actually looking your name up on Google they're going to look for your website and they're going to look at your
website and make sure it's like not tacky and not craply you
know you don't want to look make it look like crap you want to make it look 10 times bigger than you actually are
obviously so that's why that company that I
suggest go through them to get the website um but like I said the underwriters are going to look you up
because it's no personal guarantee so they have to make sure they can mitigate the risk how they can do that is
checking to make sure how legitimate you look because anybody can manipulate business credit to a certain degree it's
not very hard you know um that's why just going and blindly getting as many
trade lines as you can does not work in 2025 it didn't even work a couple years
ago it worked okay maybe doing that 10 years ago but you know the bureaus and
underwriters have smartened up so you know don't do shortcuts and don't go and
get a whole bunch of trade lines just because it says it's going to help your business's credit report in fact having
too many new trade lines reporting can actually hurt you as well because it shows you're trying to like
manipulate so that's why with my oneonone mentorship I look at everything
when I do the audit that's the first step if I accept you then I do the audit
after you filled the intake form and then after that I start based on my audit I'm going to assign you tasks so
this is like a demo account I'm showing you guys but like I tell you get Blue Vine right
um and we're actually a partner with them so you don't have to pay any fees there's like most of the time you're
going to have to pay like a monthly fee like $10 um all these business bank accounts
you have to pay like a $10 or $15 monthly maintenance fee if you don't keep so much in there but uh I
negotiated with Blueine you don't have to pay anything so if you have to use my link though but you don't have to pay
there's no deposit minimum either you know most banks they make you have a minimum deposit like $50 or $100 with uh
my link there's no minimum deposit amount you can put a dollar or anything you know um and why I have all my
students get the blue line account is because they offer working capital lines
so and plus it's it's not a it's a good business bank account i I don't
necessarily recommend have Blue Vine as your main i mean I guess it's fine but you
definitely want to probably have a Chase you know or Wells Fargo the only
reason I say that is if you go on like say fintech application and you notice
how if you connect with plaid a lot of times these smaller neo bank neo
business banks they you can't connect your business bank account uh when
you're doing the applications i'll have to actually check on that if Bluebine um Doc you said uh or Madden
you said Bluebine's your business bank account do you know because it's something that I've been meaning to
check out but do you know if um you know when you apply for anything on the
business side if it's a fentech financial technology company such as Debbie or
whatever you know when you connect your business bank account do you know do you
remember if there's Blue Vine in there that's something I've been meaning to check it keeps slipping my mind
that'd be nice if they have but I know like North One they're what they're not uh so that's the only downside about uh
like Neo Banks but if they are in Plaid now oh okay madden said it is okay so
now there's no downside at all so I didn't know that i've been meaning to
check if Plaid added Blue Vine yet but Madden said it is so yeah
uh forget that last word then so yeah I recommend everybody to get
BlueVine and like I said use my link email me after this live support
vanhorn.com and I will send you a PDF file it's kind of like a business credit
ebook that gives some tips uh I know a lot of people are waiting for that that
I said I was going to get it out to people before there's like 50ome people that requested it last time but I've
been working on it and the only reason I haven't sent it to them is it was just going to be like a one
page of tips now I'm actually putting together like a several pages
ebook basically just get you started on the business credit for free just to
guide you in the right direction and give you some uh resource links so just email support joshhv
vanhorn.com doc says how many trade lines would you recommend it depends i mean it depends
what type of trade lines but a rule of thumb you want to have minimum of three
on each bureau so like Fuelman for instance they only
report to Experian business on the first of every
month so that's one trade line but they don't report to Dun and Brad Street they
don't report to Credit Safe they don't uh report to Equifax as
well so I say across the board you want to have like three to five is kind of a
good start but again you're not going to be able to just get three or five to
have three or five three to five across with each bureau all four bureaus
including credit safe then you're probably going to need
combined 12 to 15 you know so it's rare to have any
trade line or credit line report to all four bureaus the only ones like I know that
do that are like business credit services such as fair figure nav and
ecredible they report so that can kind of count as your
uh three trade lines across three bureaus and then they fair figure
reports to credit safe and ecredible does as well so any of any
of you guys want to sign up for any of those just email me instead of just going and signing up because I mean you
can go sign up directly at those sites but however if you use my links and I
don't think I have them here handy uh where I can post them so just email me but you're going to save anywhere
from 20 to 25 to 50% off the uh
fees so like Ecredible gives you like 25% off
their monthly fee using my link uh it's exclusive i'm the only one with the discount and
then Fair Figure I think they're 35 a month but with my link they you get $10
off so uh it saves a little bit it's not much but hey every dollar you know
helps um I'll get to the comments here in a minute you guys but yeah um back to
Bluebine though why I have everybody uh all my students
get blue vine is because doing strategic methods that I teach in
the mentorship without saying too much but you can get approved for working capital
with blue vine and they even have a a credit card too that's issued by
community coastal bank that one of my students just got approved for like 6,000 and it was no hard pull on the
personal side but it's a Bluebine business credit card but they have working capital that they have several
different funding options and you're going to have much better chance to get approved for those if you bank with them
and you have that inner banking relationship built up with them
so you know I have all my students use a couple different banks business
banks so this is kind of the let's see what happened
here so like I said this is the tasks as I said this is just sample like
a demo account of mine but you can see if I assign a certain task to
you you go to this link you need to put down here it's like this one's Coast to Coast Office supplies this is like one
of the only starter vendors I'd recommend because they report to Experian and I've verified their data
license and you don't need to prepay anything
like there's several of the starter vendors that you have to prepay a fee stay away from any of the ones uh 99% of
all the ones that make you pay a fee up front stay away from them avoid them
because they probably don't report technically you can't charge a fee up front to be for a trade line like as a
data furnisher you can't actually charge upfront for a net30
account and a lot of these are charging certain fees upfront you know
so Coast to Coast I'm going to have the founder on here very soon that's one
that's good but basically I'm just showing you guys this so you have an idea what to
expect if you if I accept you and you become a oneonone student of mine you're
not going to see all these tasks though i will assign these tasks based
on what your overall goals are after I do the intake and we do the consult
call it's based on what your goals are every week I'm going to assign anywhere from five to seven tasks to you so let's
look at this one real quick this sample here so use the
nav just because I want to show you guys this one because this one there's a couple ones that I actually know that
nobody else talks about and I've made videos about them a little bit but there's a couple ones
that are like hidden gems that there's no other videos out there about
these i don't know where it's at here it's a headache all these cards uh
trying to sort them they used to have them on a board or
whatever i don't know where it's at i thought I had it here um but it's trip
actions it used to be called trip actions now it's navan so this is just example uh they
offer a corporate card so you would go to the link that I
have in there and this is like a tutorial that I put
together step one you're going to go to the link in the tutorial you know you can see
here and then after that I made a guide just to make it easier for you guys to
my students and I'm going to start doing this as well for my rigger videos on the
channel but it opens up a site that's navan same as what you're seeing here so
it shows get started and walks you through each step
right what to do because you're not going to see a uh apply for business credit here you're not going to really
see that it's not really that's not the main thing they're
offering they offer but uh you know they're trying to promote to
get clientele businesses that need travel right and then they offer a
credit line for travel expenses and you can use it for other things too that card's unlocked to anything
but basically you have to go through setting up your account fully like this
and then after that you're going to see this set up reimbursements and name and connect add
a corporate card you're going to see that you have to set up all this and then after you set up your bill billing
profile then you'll see where it's it will offer you to apply for their
expense card now they don't give super high limits i think they only gave me
like I don't even remember exactly i don't use it very often like five or
6,000 um and some of my other students I don't think we've ever got anyone higher
than like 12,000 so they're not going to give super high limits but hey it helps
you know it all adds up if you have you know 10 no PG business cards and each
one of them are 10 or let's just say five to 20,000 limit each that's over a
quarter million dollars right there it's not very hard to
do so that's just kind of an example after you do it you need to put like
this you tag me like it will show at credit Josh tag and then you just type I
got approved or I got denied whatever it may be as you can see here so I require
all my students to do that if you don't actually do that I assign you five or seven tasks and say week one and if you
just hit mark done up here and you don't actually
comment and let me know the outcome then I'm not going to assign new task to you the following week so it's communication
is vital it's very important for the communication to be there okay so um
because main reason I say that is those five initial tasks that I
assign you based on the outcome of those five tasks is going to dictate what I feel I
want you to go after for week two and then so forth every
week that's how I decide the tasks each week is based on the outcome of the
previous week okay so anyways like I said these are
all the tasks you're going to mark done each one but if you come on as a student
I approve you you join you're not going to see all these tasks okay you're only going to see like
some foundation tasks like NAV fair figure ecredible after I do the audit that's
when I will assign the custom tasks so if like two people could sign up tonight right
both you two won't have the same tasks so unless they're foundation tasks
of course like better business bureau or nav fair figure but I don't have
everybody go after like say uh this travel card i don't have everybody go after that there's so many factors that
go into when I assign tasks like say capital on tap that limits 14,000
Um and that one's good it's It's not revolving but you can pay they have a
thing where you can either pay in full every month or 10% so if you charge
10,000 one month you need to pay back a,000 the next month and then that
following month you need to pay back minimum 900 it requires 10% of the balance
so hope that clarifies things um what else was I going to talk
on i was going to say something else so this is another one that I'm going to be
making a video here soon and I'm actually going to have the founder on we just have to work out a good time it was
supposed to happen last month but I got busy with some health issues but
um this is a business credit card and they actually allow you 60 days to pay of no interest and you can rob it as
well and it's no impact to your credit score and it's no uh
PG and you get uh 1.75% unlimited cash back on select
purchases keep cash on hand for up to 28 times
longer than traditional cards at 0% so of course this one I'll tell you
up front is not going to be easy to get unless you have one good personal credit
or two you have good business credit build up because they're going to look
at um the combined both of them
so this one's really unique though that's why I'm excited to uh put out content and do that interview because
there really is no other card quite like this ramp is kind of like they give you
60 days uh RAMP will give you up to 60 days if you qualify for the flex line
but this one you can actually revolt it which is nice and it's not PG
so stay tuned for that that's why everybody needs to make sure they're they subscribe and all notifications
turned on because um I'm going to be dropping a lot of new content this month in
June anybody in like rehabbing homes or real estate this is um
regions they give credit lines so I made a video about that as
well there's so much to touch on and I actually don't want to cover too much on
each individual one because it's so late for you guys i just kind of want to give you guys an update and let you guys know
about the new client portal coming soon anybody interested in my oneonone business credit mentorship
um you can apply you have two options you can actually text me
9374239954 you can text me right now and then after this live stream I will text
you back and we can uh do a consultation call even tonight if it's
not too late for you so um you can either do
that let me see i'm reading comments here or you can go
to the intake form i just posted it
there it's secure.credit.cc uh just go to the link
i need to make a shortened one but you want to fill this out
and this is just basically me able to pre-screen um it doesn't ask too much
question so you should be able to fill this out in like 10 minutes um but basically you fill this out and I
will get back to you and let you know if I can qualify you for my 101 business
credit mentorship because I only approve maybe 5 to 10% of the people that contact me like I get over 10 people a
day reaching out or consultation and those consultations that I do you know
it can be several days go by and I don't approve anybody um and then there could be other days where I approve free
people because the goals have to be aligned that's why I don't have any
um negative reviews online at all anything like that
because I need to make sure that the goals are aligned i'm going to just tell you whatever you want to hear and if I
feel that you're up to no good that's another reason why I required this
because I'm friends with some of the underwriters and I don't want to um send them scammers either as well you know so
and some people are just unrealistic they're like "Oh I want to get 100,000 in in the next 30 days," but they're a
brand new business and they're pre-revenue and they don't have good credit it's like you
know so those are the main reasons you know but anyways the link's right there
you guys can check that out i'll go over the questions
now but yeah make sure you guys uh definitely turn on all notifications on
for future videos if they're not already be and that always doesn't work either
youtube is kind of weird about that sometimes they don't alert pe you know people so check back to every couple
days on the channel for the new content because I'm definitely going to be releasing in the month of June at least
10 to 12 new videos that you don't want to miss out on kind of things I'm touching on right
now so I'll go through the comments real quick but yeah anybody interested in my
business credit 101 uh mentorship just text now uh 937-4239954 that's my personal cell
phone i think um I have four or five spots left i don't
take on more than 60 students at one time i think I'm have 55 or 56 it
fluctuates uh because some people are ending some people are extending you know I would say 50% of my students
always extend from like say 12 weeks or 16 weeks to 26 weeks um because they
start getting approvals and they want to get more and more and learn strategies as well because my mentorship's not just
about getting trade lines and approvals it's also to learn strategies and increase limits as well and how to
leverage so okay but as I said if you text me now I will
text you back after this live and we can either do a quick phone consultation to see if you'd be a good fit either
tonight and if it's too late for you tonight then I can uh we can schedule
something for tomorrow during the afternoon or morning all right I'll get in the
comments now
madden madden I've been meaning to get back to you i apologize about that um my
son got a fever last time when you text me
um so text me back tonight is just to remind me because I get so many get end
up getting so busy text me back i want to get you set up maybe on the new client portal so you can give me some
feedback on that as well um and Doc you can do the same thing
since you guys are my moderators here uh my Experian business score is great dmbb
score great but Equifax is still low man they tough probably not reporting is probably
the problem because there's so many that say they report to Equifax but they actually don't so let me know which ones
that you think should be reporting or that you have text me that and I'll let
you know which ones because some of them actually just lost their data furnishing licenses with Equifax too
recently but Equifax is usually the easy one to get because there's abundance of
trade lines that report to Equifax before but you know it's tightened up and that's because the bureaus are
catching on to these people that get the data furnishing license they start these
sites like some offsp strategic network solutions and they're charging fees up front and they can't be charging fees up
front as a to be a data furnisher you can't offer a net30 account and then
make them pay up front that's not
net30 yeah you guys smashed the um definitely smashed the like button i
appreciate that doc Doug says "Hey Josh why get a real
address for virtual address or PO box?" Definitely don't do a PO box and definitely don't do I postal real
address is better if you have a real address real business address but if you don't have that like then like don't use
your home address either because that's going to limit you on what you can get approved for as
well especially with the Fent underwriters uh virtual address
um anybody looking for a virtual address don't go out and get like anytime
mailbox even though I promoted them before some addresses with anytime mail inbox are fine especially those that are on a
budget but you just have to do some research and find the correct address but I can give you guys a link that uh
will save you some money on a virtual address addresses that I actually trust that are premium
locations and I will actually look up the addresses for you on my credit safe
um profile portal uh system where I can put in the address of the potential
virtual address that you're looking to get and then it will actually tell me the risk rating so you want to avoid
ones that are high risk uh rating so they go from zero it goes from zero to
10 and you want to have the lowest score possible if it's and all of them are
going to have some type of risk to them even normal addresses are still going to
have some type of risk because it's a history of that address or that office
building so you want to typically be under six or lower uh that's another video idea i
need to make a video about that showing the credit safe dashboard you guys won't
be able to see it uh on your credit safe just because you guys aren't data
furniture but I can pull people's business credit and everything so I'll show you guys that in on another video i
need to make that video actually so I can show you guys like what to look for but anybody looking for
a business address if you don't already have one um or if you have IP postal or a PO box
and you want some advice for free I'll give you advice and give you a couple addresses that would
be not high risk and they'll save you some money as
well on that um let's see here
madden says "When you have a good relationship with them they'll basically give you anything." Okay see Madden said
right there I was talking about Blue Vine that's
good yeah Madden um maybe more recently but there's still some that
um are reporting to them just you have to make sure you have the right ones
uh what do you say here uh they are asking a million dollar
loan well yeah i get people all the time that's why I have to turn down and pre-screen people like I have
a you know
the you guys just so you guys know that like I don't even use this card even though I should for how much it costs
but you know the Centarian Black uh and by only American's first business
card so people believe it or not man will do
a consultation with me and they will tell me if I can get them the American
Express invite only card then they'll join my mentorship and I'm like okay
it's invite only for one i don't have any control over American Express i can only tell you what I did um but even
like what I did doesn't guarantee that you're going to get it you know it's invite only so but yeah I mean I have so
many people that contact me and they're just so unrealistic so if you're looking for quick cash just to let you guys know
so you don't waste my time and don't waste your time either don't fill out this form don't contact me if you're
thinking you can join the mentorship and you have a bad personal credit score and
you're try you're have no business revenue coming in and you're trying to get like $100,000 in the next 30 days
that's just not realistic it's not going to happen um you know I do work with
people that have challenging credit personal credit but it's a case- byase
basis so um that is a factor don't expect to get
a you know the same results as other students that have a 750 personal FICO
when you have a 550 it doesn't matter if it's PG or no PG it doesn't matter
because Fentex uh not all but most Fentex still will do a soft pull on your
personal credit or the business owner's personal credit you know there's so many variables and
factors that go into um business credit and there's no
one-sizefits-all you know unfortunately there's so many people on YouTube giving such bad advice out there like saying
business credit scores matter business credit scores don't matter and then they're talking about
like get two nav accounts be by using two different email addresses get it
Sunb Belt Rentals it's like there's a place for sunb belt rentals but 99% of people have no use for sunb belt rentals
but there's just so much bad mix information out there telling you get as many tree lines as you can focus on done
and Brad Street don't even focus on Dun and Brad Street because they're rarely used for decision making for um
financially related like working capital or business credit cards like they're
rarely used it's mainly like industrial supply granger uses Dun Brad Street
um manufacturers computer parts like that you know some equipment financing may
pull underwriters may pull Den Brad Street but if you're trying to get like
actual business credit cards and working capital lines revolving lines draw lines
store cards gas cards 98% of time the underwriter will
be using uh Experian business credit that's why I pre-choice like focus on
your Experian business credit profile now if you're trying to get
um say a fleet of vehicles a sprinter van or vehicles for
Turo company cars that are you know no PG then you need to focus on your credit
safe and your Equifax because like Ally in
particular that's what who they use is Equifax and Credit Safe and a lot of the other ones even
like Ford Motor Credit a lot of the underwriters when it comes to uh vehicle financing in the business no PG they're
using Equifax and Credit Safe in
tandem yeah they think I have a key to the vault i may have the key to the vault on some business credit things
more than anybody else but I don't have the key to the vault with American Express you know I'm friends with a lot
of the underwriters but American Express is not one of them you know I I may have
uh so many American Express cards i literally had like 12 of them business
and personal but yeah not uh yeah I don't definitely don't have uh
any connection to American Express but I can only share what I did with American Express and my journey i actually
already made a video about that if you guys look back a couple years ago or just go to my channel and type in credit
Josh American Express and I tell you exactly what I did and what I think possibly triggered the invite for the
black card but anyways I don't want to talk about the black card too much because it's a ripoff really it's
$10,000 it's more of a flex card than anything that's the only reason I got it but it's $10,000 if you accept the offer
that's the initiation fee and then 5,000 uh per year after that as the annual fee
yes there's things that you can do justify the annual fee but it's honestly it's like 70 80% of what the American
Express Platinum card is so you're better off getting that you know
so anyways uh it's already almost 12 o'clock Eastern Standard Time but
anyways you again um I'll have this as a replay and I'll probably re-release it
tomorrow and clean it up a bit but uh anybody interested in my 101 business credit mentorship just text me the
