EIN Only NO PG Business Cards That Build Business Credit FAST!
we're going to discuss some tier 
accounts so you can further utilize
these to establish your business credit
profile there are actually four
different business credit tiers that you
can use when you're building your
business credit if you understand how
these tiers work they can help you find
the right financing to meet your needs
while you're building your business
credit and if you stick around until the
end of the video I'm going to provide
you a no PG EIN only business card that
if approved account holders can
potentially access up to $in
business working capital i'm going to
also provide a referral link that will
go directly to a sales manager to
prioritize your application of this
business card so without further ado
let's get right into the video let's
Tier 
begin with the recap of tier accounts
tier credit is commonly referred to as
basic trade credit and is the most
readily accessible type of business
financing you generally don't need to
establish business credit history or a
high personal FICO score for you to get
approved for these accounts from vendors
at this level what's more you typically
don't need to provide a personal
guarantee that means most tier one
business credit vendors cannot come
after your personal assets if your
company was to default and making basic
trade credit the least risky form of
business financing and as a result tier
credit accounts are a great way to
build your business credit from scratch
they can help you establish a handful of
initial trade lines with each major
business credit bureau and lay the
foundation of credit for more essential
financing in the future conveniently
tier business credit vendors are often
supply stores that sell practical items
for a small business owner trying to get
off the ground however tier credit
accounts are often allowances for no
longer repayment terms than days
which means they must be repaid within
that -day time frame and that's also
the reason why most people refer to
these accounts as nets as a result
though you won't incur interest with
basic trade credit as long as you pay by
the required due date but you won't be
able to finance anything for very long
Tier | Credit Profile
either next let's discuss the typical
credit profile needed for a tier 
credit account tier credit accounts
have the least demanding eligibility
requirements and you should be able to
qualify for some of them without any
previous business credit which is why we
want to start here you can also qualify
even if you have bad personal credit
however you do need to meet the
following requirements you need to
operate a business that's in the United
States have an IRSissue tax ID your
federal EIN you need to also have a Dun
and Bradstreet issued Dun's number you
want to be established for at least 
days you want to have no derogatory
business reporting or delinquencies and
applicants must be an authorized officer
of the organization now with that said
some of the requirements for basic trade
credit vary between vendors for example
a majority of tier one accounts that I
mentioned in my how to build business
credit in days video did not require
you to be established for at least 
days and some may require that you have
other tier accounts before approving
you as a result you may need to shop
around to get your first trade line i
highly recommend that you refer back to
that video if you are just beginning to
establish your business you're going to
look for the video that shows you how to
actually structure your business and
then you can look at the one about
building business credit with nets and
then once you're done with both of those
if you want to come back and watch this
video this will be the next level so you
can get those tier accounts we're now
Tier 
moving on to tier business credit also
known as advanced trade credit though
it's still a form of vendor financing it
gives small business owners access to
higher lines of credit and longer
repayment terms than you would get on
basic trade line accounts if you qualify
you'll receive a dedicated card attached
to some of your credit line and the size
will depend on your business's
qualifications advanced trade credit
accounts help you round out your
business credit report before you
transition into more traditional
business financing such as installment
loans or getting credit cards from a
financial institution because they're
harder to qualify for and involve larger
sums of money they may look better as
trade lines on your business credit
report and as a result you should think
about applying for them as soon as
you're confident that your chances of
qualifying are very high the typical
Tier | Credit Profile
credit profile needed for tier credit
accounts will be a little bit different
than tier tier business credit
vendors have more restrictive
qualification requirements than your
normal tier providers so to get
advanced trade credit accounts you
usually need between to five tier 
accounts with positive payment history
sometimes you may need to have a
personal guarantee but usually it's
unlikely you may also need to have 
years of operating history to qualify
for tier accounts now that we've
Tier & 
discussed tier and tier and what it
takes to qualify I also want to discuss
tier three and tier now the accounts
that we're looking at today will not be
tier and tier but it's just good for
you to actually be aware of what these
are in contrast with vendor trade lines
these accounts come from organizations
that specialize in offering financing
like banks and credit unions to qualify
for tier three you should aim to have a
solid business credit history with a
dozen or so tier and tier trade
credit accounts you should also have a
good business credit score and a track
record of making timely monthly payments
while tier three credit accounts are
significantly more challenging to
qualify for than the business trade
lines in the previous tiers they're
usually well worth the effort they're
the best way to secure large amounts of
flexible capital that you can use to
grow your business for example you can
get a small business administration and
SBA loan for up to $million and use
the proceeds for various purposes
including acquiring property improving
real estate or just your own working
capital i have an entire video that goes
over SBA loans and I talk about the
importance of establishing a business
credit profile and what that means to
get approved if you would like to watch
that video I'm going to link that here
Tier 
tier business funding is very
different from tiers that we've
discussed previously it refers to an
arrangement in which you raise capital
from an investor such as venture
capitalist or an angel investor rather
than a credit arrangement where you
borrow from a vendor or traditional
lenders notably these investors usually
prefer equity financing arrangements
which require you to give up partial
ownership of your company so for example
it might involve selling % of your
corporation's outstanding shares of
common stock equity is generally more
expensive than debt in the long run but
doesn't come with a fixed monthly
payment as a result it can be an
attractive option for businesses that
have already taken out significant
amounts of debt and can't afford to
borrow anymore in addition these
investors can bring much more than
capital to the table they're often
experts of scaling the types of
companies that they're invested in and
they offer invaluable guidance they're
also literally invested in your success
so it's in their best interest to help
you as much as possible good business
credit score certainly won't hurt your
chances of convincing these investors to
work with you but it's usually not their
primary concern they're typically more
interested in startups that have high
growth potential and can provide a
lucrative return now I'm going to share
three tier accounts with you as well
as the business card that you can use
that goes up to $our first tier
st Account
account is the -Eleven commercial
fleet masterard now this is ideal for
businesses that want to fuel exclusively
at -Eleven or Speedway Stations with
this card your business can save up to 
cents per gallon for the first months
and continue to save cents per gallon
every time they fill up at participating
locations there's no setup fee there's
no annual fee or card fees which makes
this a very lowcost solution for
business owners fleet cards are
generally a great stepping stone some of
them are more easily accessible in the
early stages of building your credit
than others and I was approved for this
one days ago and it was a $
credit limit with semionthly repayment
terms and of course no personal
guarantee so if you've already
established five to seven tier one
accounts and you're looking for the next
level this is definitely a recommended
one for you this card should report to
Experian business as well as done in
Bradreet according to the representative
that I spoke with however I don't know
this for sure things change all the time
i was just approved days ago and the
one thing I can confirm is that you can
get this card with no personal guarantee
if you want any more details about this
card there's a link in the description
where you can apply and if you are
approved please leave a comment below
with the approval amount i love to hear
that from you our second tier account
nd Account
is going to be the J C Penney commercial
account this includes a plastic card for
you and any authorized users that you
have to purchase anything in store at J
C Penney or at JCP.com
now this card comes with a netterm
and it is backed by Synchrony Bank this
card also reports to Experian Business
and Done in Brad i did apply for this
card and I was approved for $with
the netterms again it's no PG there's
very little information about this
account so unfortunately I can't give
any more details however what I can say
is I wasn't approved right away i did
have to call when you complete the
application there's a section that does
ask you for a personal guarantee you
unselect that and you can continue
without it now I did include a link in
the description to apply let me know if
you're approved for this one as well our
rd Account
third tier account is going to be the
Lowe's commercial account now if you run
a business in construction or renovation
property management landscaping anything
like that this will be a great option
for you it gives you % discount on all
your purchases it also provides a net 
term which can be helpful for managing
cash flow and includes benefits like
discounted delivery and bulk rate
pricing this tier account will report

Bradreet and I was approved for a $
credit limit and it does have by monthly
terms again that's days with no

The $K Business Credit Card
promised here is the $card that
you can qualify for and that's going to
be the revenue flex line in business
card now we've discussed this business
card in my top three EIN only PG card
video and if you haven't seen that I
highly recommend that you watch this i
do have a referral link that was
provided to me if you go to the
description this will go directly to a
sales manager to prioritize your
application this Flex Line Plus Business
Card works best for a small business
owner looking for fast flexible funding
to access working capital whenever it's
needed there is no draw fees there's no
maintenance cost and there's no minimum
credit score that's required you borrow
exactly what you need when you need it
with limits up to $these funds
can be deposited directly into your
business bank account or they can be
accessed through revenue's Visa business
card approvals for this business card
will be based on your business revenue
and not your personal credit however
Requirements
while your personal credit score isn't a
part of the decision-making process you
do need to have a few baseline
requirements hit first your business
must be at least one year old revenue
wants to see a consistent track record
of revenue over time second you must
have a dedicated business checking
account this account needs to show at
least months of consistent activity
revenue uses the account to evaluate
your deposits and also to set up your
repayment schedule so it is important
that your transactions are clean and
very easy to verify third your business
needs to generate at least $in
monthly deposits now that might sound
like a lot but if you're already
operating with multiple clients or
running payroll you're likely to easily
hit those numbers and I have plenty of
videos that talk about how you can show
your business revenue and exactly what
you're generating revenue uses your
actual revenue not projections or credit
history as the main criteria for
determining your approval and to get
this flex line limit of up to $
also your business entity must be an LLC
an S Corp a CC Corp or a partnership and
finally your business must be a US-based
business in order to qualify once again
the referral link is in the description
if you believe that you meet the
criteria I highly recommend that you use
the link that way it goes to a dedicated
sales manager and you can be approved in
