These $Credit Cards Instantly Approve Anyone Even with NO INCOME PROOF NO JOB
Â first you want to try to find credit
cards that's going to at least start
with $limits okay now I'm going
tell you the five credit cards that I
would take a look at also looking at
those credit cards another thing about
it is in reference to those credit cards
you're going to be able to use that same
inquiry to get more funding out of these
institutions right so
here here's here's the thing about it so
let's talk about the credit cards first
because this this is exciting so guys
please bear with me all right
so let's talk about the credit cards all
right so the first credit card is the
MGM World Mastercard well let me back up
because you need to understand this
whenever you're trying to find $or
more credit card there's certain credit
cards you have to look for okay this is
very important now what do I mean by
that is that
usually your $
uh credit cards they would either be a
Visa Signature
a Visa Infinite
or a World Master Card okay those are
your credit cards all right those are
the type of credit cards and most of the
time and I'll I'll show it to you most
of the time these here credit cards all
right they would probably be more likely
uh cash back or cash reward type of
cards all right just giving you some uh
preference of what what to actually look
for all right now the first one going
back to MGM
World Mastercard okay that's starts at
$
all right now
I would tell you this just keep that in
mind because what I'm going to help with
you especially like I said getting into
the real estate game just keep that in
mind all right
now you also have PNC okay so with PNC
they have the cash unlimited
now this here credit card gives you 
months on balance transfers right so
when you get the card that $card
or more that you can transfer the
balance over to your checking account
all right so they would use Experian
FICO all right now that's the bank PNC
Bank
now the next card
I would say is BCU baxter Credit Union
okay so they have a cash rewards card
starts at $
now that's a Vantage three okay that's a
Vantage um
TransUnion okay now
to forgive me i'm a little excited um
now
the next one is your Navy Federal Cash
Rewards starts at $
okay
now again
pay attention because these credit cards
are um
Visa usually Visa now here's the thing
about it with with a Navy Federal okay
that cash rewards it can be Visa
Mastercard
now remember trying to get you all in
the real estate game so pay attention
here's the thing about it with Navy
Federal credit cards you actually
can
liquidate that card over to a debit card
okay the prepaid debit card the go card
right you all hear me talk about it all
right so but it has to be the Visa
Mastercard you can't do it with the Navy
Federal U more rewards at American
Express that's not the card to get don't
go after that card all right so with
Navy Federal we all know they use
TransUnion okay transunion FICO all
right so a low hanging fruit is what I'm
paying attention to with these cards
most of these cards now here's the thing
about it uh we have another one on the
list and I'm going to talk about that
one in a minute
let's think about it that means that
you're okay with adding on your
authorized users right and your rental
payments okay your uh utility bills okay
many of you may not even be aware that
you can actually uh help aid your credit
file not only with the authorized users
and the uh utility bills many people are
not even aware of that utility bills but
you would have to go through um Identity
IQ okay you would have to go through
Identity IQ what I'mma do is I'mma sit
here at this barbecue grill place
so
waiting on my m my wife and my daughter
to get uh ready all right so
like I said with uh Identity IQ
you can actually um
aid your credit file okay with with the
utilities all right so that's the reason
why that's important all right now
let's talk about the last one all right
and that's the State Department Federal
Credit Union all right now they have a
premium cash card okay cash cash card
and it's a Experian mortgage score now
here's the thing about it that most
people are not aware of
i keep telling people that you do need
to know your mortgage score because
there are credit unions out in the
market that are willing to work with you
okay but you need to know your mortgage
score all right and so in order for you
to do that you would have to go to my
FICO i'll put a link in the description
uh for you to check that out or you when
you click on the go look for a loan you
would see it there if you pull that and
you want me to do an analysis
of your uh personal credit you schedule
a one-on-one consultation and I'll
actually show you how to use the system
and I will go over some of the uh credit
unions you may want to look at depending
on your scores okay so that's the reason
why I'm sharing that with you that's the
reason I tell people whenever you're
looking for money you always want to use
that system because % of the uh banks
use that system all right now here's the
thing about it people know all right
let's just say focusing on the credit
unions you also have PinFed okay so with
PinFed I always tell people to go for
the gold card okay the reason is because
it gives you months on balance
transfers okay um they don't charge a
transfer fee all right now just helping
you get access to the cash cuz I know
some of you are like "Okay where does
the real estate come in at?" But think
about it let's uh state department and
like I said these credit unions mainly
with the credit unions all right once
they do the hard pull on the credit and
I'm telling you if you hovering about a
cuz some of these credit unions will
work with you with a okay uh like I
said just depends especially like with a
advantage score or Navy Federal car as
many of us know that they usually
depending on the relationship they
usually will work with you with a lower
score than that okay so the credit
unions when they do a hard pull on your
credit okay you can use that hard pull
usually
to apply for other loans okay whether it
be a car loan or a personal loan now the
personal loan I would do and the credit
union that I would make a priority is is
with State Department Federal Credit
Union okay and the reason is is because
not only that $credit card but
they will also give you up to a $
personal loan okay or a line of credit
now that's very important and the reason
it's very important because they give
you up to days to make your first
payment
