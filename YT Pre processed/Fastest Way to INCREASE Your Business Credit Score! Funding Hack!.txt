Fastest Way to INCREASE Your Business Credit Score! Funding Hack!
This is the fastest way to grow your
business credit score.
Did you know that not building your
business credit from day one could cost
you $
or more in funding over the next few
years? In today's video, I'm going to
show you the fastest way to build your
business credit and unlock over a
quarter of a million dollars in funding
step by step. This is the same strategy
I used to secure over $for my
business. Without this, Dispute Beast
wouldn't even exist today. I wouldn't
have had the money to grow and scale.
And here's the crazier part. Most
business owners never even start
building their business credit properly,
and they wonder why lenders keep saying
no. So, make sure that you stick with me
through the entire video because if you
miss even one of these steps, you'll
leave thousands of dollars on the table.
But let's start with the biggest
question. Why does business credit even
matter? Well, most people think, uh,
I'll just use my personal credit for
now. But that's a huge mistake. Because
here's what happens when you don't build
with business credit. You get denied by
banks because your business has no
credit history. You'll have to max out
personal credit cards, which tanks your
personal FICO score, or you'll pay
higher interest fees. And worst of all,
when you finally do need funding to
grow, you won't qualify. And that's
exactly why you need to build your
business credit from the very first day
you open your business checking account.
Business credit is what lenders look at
to decide whether your company is
trustworthy. And the sooner you start,
the better your chances of unlocking
high limit cards, lines of credit, and
those massive loans that you're looking
for. Let me tell you my story real
quick. When I started my business, I
signed up for my free Dun's number,
which is your free Dun and Brad Street
number. And there is where I found
something very interesting. It's called
the credit builder service. They help me
open my business credit file and start
reporting trade lines to build my payex
score. Now, a lot of people are going to
argue on the internet, oh, a payex score
doesn't matter. Well, in some instances,
it does not. But the information that
you're building with Dun and Bradreet is
very valuable. And that's exactly why I
started with Dun and Bradre. And then a
little while later is when I opened up
my Nav account and that's when things
really took off. Both Dunn and Bradstre
and Nav have been my go-to business
credit partners for over years now.
Through their platforms and their Nav
Prime membership, I was able to monitor
all of my business credit scores, report
trade lines every single month, and
secure funding offers I never knew I
even qualified for. Honestly, thanks to
NAV and Dun and Bradreet working
together, I grew my business credit
score and ended up with over $
in funding. And today, I'm going to walk
you through exactly how to use both of
these tools to grow your credit even
faster. So, I'm going to break this
video down into five very important
steps that you do not want to miss. If
you miss any of these, again, you're
leaving thousands of dollars on the
table. But, I want to say something
before I jump into this list. If you're
someone out there that's building your
credit using different types of trade
lines like Granger and Uline, there's
nothing wrong with that. It's just going
to take you longer. I want to be really
clear on that because a lot of people
will ask me, "Are these trash? Are they
not?" No, they're going to help you
build business credit, but
unfortunately, those take way too long.
So, let's jump into step number one.
Open your business checking account.
This is so crucial. Step one is very
obvious, but you'd be surprised how many
people skip it. Open your business
checking account and do not mix business
and personal money. And here's another
reason why I recommend opening it
through NAV. They offer a checking
account with zero fees. It integrates
with your NAV dashboard and it positions
you for better offers down the line.
Now, you can open your Nav checking
account right now through the link below
in the video description and it sets the
foundation for everything else. And also
be aware, there is nothing wrong with
having multiple different types of
business checking accounts. In fact, I
recommend that you have anywhere from
three to five business checking accounts
to handle different types of your money.
And this is why I also recommend Blue
Vine because it's going to give you cash
back for any time that you're using your
business debit card. Link is going to be
in the description for all of these
things that we talk about today in case
you need them. Now, moving on to step
number two, which is set up your Nav
Prime. Next, you're going to sign up for
Nav Prime membership. Here's why Nav
Prime is so powerful. Every month, your
subscription fee is reported to the
business credit bureaus as a trade line
automatically. You get full visibility
into all your business credit scores
done in Brad Street, Experian business,
Equifax business, all in one dashboard.
You also unlock funding offers you might
not have seen anywhere else tailored to
your specific profile. If you want to
see all of your credit scores, if you
were to do this individually, you would
have to pay for Experian business,
Equifax business, done in Bradreet
business, all of those completely
separate. Here you get them all for the
same low price, which I absolutely love
because I learned this the hard way. I
went and actually bought all of them and
I'm like, "Yo, this is so expensive just
to see my business credit scores." So,
if you're serious about building
business credit, Nav Prime is
non-negotiable. It gives you that
consistent trade line reporting month
after month. You can sign up through my
link in the video description to get
started today. I want to give a special
shout out to all my Beasters out there
that are working hard to fix their
credit using Dispute Beast, the most
advanced AI credit repair software ever
created that comes with a % money
back guarantee. but specifically to
Brandon. Brandon's credit score went up
points after just one round with
Dispute Beast. And Ashley, Ashley's
credit score went up points after
just two rounds with Dispute Beast. But
let's not forget about Julio. Julio's
credit score went up points after
just one round with Dispute Beast.
Dispute Beast link is going to be pinned
at the very top of the comments and in
the video description for anyone that
needs to fix their credit. Now, moving
on to step number three. The Nav Prime
card. Here's where it gets even better.
Nav launched the Nav Prime card and it's
a gamecher. This single card reports two
trade lines every month. One to your
business credit and one to your personal
credit. It's a revolving trade line
which helps your utilization and your
overall credit profile. And just like
the membership, it integrates seamlessly
into your NAV dashboard. When you
combine the Nav Prime membership with
the Nav Prime card, you're stacking
multiple trade lines and building
history fast. This is why I always
recommend applying for this card as soon
as you sign up for Nav Prime. And
there's no hard inquiry to see if you're
qualified for it. Step number four, set
up your Dun and Bradreet credit builder.
Now, we talked about the Dun and
Bradreet number. That's % free, but
the Dun and Bradreet credit builder
account is completely different. It is
not free. So next you'll want to set up
your Dun and Brashre credit builder
account. And here's why. Done and Bradre
is the original business credit bureau.
They assign your business its Payex
score. Lenders, vendors, even government
contracts use Dun and Brad Street scores
to assess your business. Their paid
credit builder service lets you report
your own trade lines, which is a huge
boost early on. And this is exactly how
I boosted my credit score for my
business even faster. Dun and Brad
Street has been helping me manage my
business credit profile for over years
now and pairing them with NAV
accelerated my growth more than anything
else I tried. So, let me break down the
credit builder as quickly as I possibly
can. Now, the credit builder is not
free. It's either on a monthly basis or
a contract for a one full year that you
can cancel after that, but you have to
sign up for a minimum of a -month
contract. So, if you're going to do
this, make sure that you're prepared and
you have the proper trade lines and you
have a strategy on how to use this so
you don't waste your money. So, let's
say you purchase something from me,
another business owner, for bucks,
whatever it may be. Now, you
have the ability to report that to the
credit builder service as a transaction.
Now, all you're going to need is the
actual receipt, the phone number, the
contact information of the business that
you actually purchased something as a
business, and you report that to the
credit builder. Now, credit builder Dun
and Bradreet will actually go back to
that other company and see if it's
actually true and factual and then they
will report that trade line. So, listen,
I got a little out of control with this
because you I think it's like you can
report up to or depending on which
tier you choose. So, I tried to get as
many as I could in. I reached out to
everybody that I'd worked with, any
contractors, anybody that I'd exchanged
actual money for their services with my
business. I said, "Hey, listen. Can I
please report you to my credit builder
service? So with Dun and Brady so I can
build my business credit score.
Everyone's like, "Yeah, sure." They
verified the information and then Dun
and Brady reported it and
instantaneously like I saw my business
credit score shoot up over like and
points in the first days and then
days the moment it started reporting.
And then of course Nav Prime kicked in
almost exactly at the same time because
I tried to time it perfectly where it
could affect my business credit score
within that to day window. And
within days of me doing this, my
credit score shot to the moon for my
business credit. And I was just like
shocked. I was like, "It does work."
It's true. I didn't have to get any gas
cards. I didn't have to do any Uline,
any Granger. And I'll be honest with
you, I tried to start with I think it
was Uline or Granger. And the process
was like so long for me to get set up,
then for them to give me a line of
credit, then for me to purchase. I was
like, "Yo, this is way too much." And I
started doing the research. That's how I
got to this point. I started doing as
much research on the different types of
tools that I could use to build my
business credit and that's what led me
to the Dun and Brad Street Credit
Builder and then NAV and here we are
with over $in funding within
that first year.
Last part's the most important but
moving on to step number five. Stay
consistent and scale. Here's the most
important part. Consistency. Building
business credit is not a oneanddone
thing. These are the four things that
you need to focus on. Pay everything on
time. Keep your utilization low. Monitor
your scores monthly in NAV and keep
adding positive trade lines over time
because your contract with Dun and Brady
is going to be a month contract. Use
it as much as you possibly can for that
first year and then you could be done.
Remember, every single transaction with
your business is an opportunity to
report a trade line. If you do this
every month, you'll see your limits go
up, your approvals come easier, and your
business credit profile grows stronger.
And before you know it, you'll have
access to maybe even
more. But what if you don't start today?
Let me paint the picture for you. You're
denied for funding when you desperately
need it. You max out personal cards and
hurt your personal credit. And I'm going
to tell you right now, it's the biggest
mistake I see all the time. People are
heavily in debt on their personal cards,
destroying their personal credit, and we
don't want that. You pay ridiculous
interest rates, if you qualify at all,
and you watch your competitors pass you
by because they took the time to build
their business credit properly. Don't
let that be your story. Start building
now because the best time to plant a
tree was years ago. The second best
time is today. So, let's do a quick
recap. Here's what you need to do right
now. Open your business checking account
with NAV. Sign up for Nav Prime
membership. You can also set up an
account with BlueVine to get you started
with that. Apply for your Nav Prime card
and set up your Dun and Bradstreet
credit builder. Now, all the links are
going to be in the video description
below. So, go take action now. So, I
hope you enjoyed this video. We covered
another big one on how to build your
business credit score faster.
