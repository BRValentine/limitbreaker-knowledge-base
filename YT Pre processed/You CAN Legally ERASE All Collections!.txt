You CAN Legally ERASE All Collections! Watch this Now!
This is the number one credit repair
mistake that people make when dealing
with hoax debt collectors.
If you've got a collection account on
your credit report, don't pay a dime
until you watch this. They don't want
you to know this. The credit bureaus,
the collection companies, the shady
third-party debt buyers, they're praying
you never see this video. Because if you
knew the truth about collections, you'd
never pay them the way they want. You'd
never fear them the way they expect. And
you could flip the script entirely,
legally wiping debts off your credit
report, even if you owed it. This video
could be the difference between a 
and a between paying $in
interest or paying nothing. So sit tight
because in the next minutes, I'm
giving you the truth they hide in the
fine print. Here's why this is one of
the most important videos you'll ever
watch. % of your credit score is based
on payment history and collections hit
that hard. Even paid collections can
destroy your credit score. You're judged
by lenders, landlords, even employers,
all based on the same exact data. Fixing
this isn't just about credit. It's about
freedom. It all starts with
understanding how collections really
work. I'm going to break this down into
five truths that you do not want to
miss. And then right after that, I'm
going to teach you exactly how to remove
those collections the right way. So,
let's not waste any more time and let's
Most collections are not verified
jump into truth number one. Most
collections are not verified. Here's the
first truth they hope you never
discover. Most collections on your
credit report are not legally verified.
Debt collectors buy your info for
pennies on the dollar, then report it to
the bureaus with zero documentation. I
mean, think about it. Isn't that kind of
crazy? But under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, they are required to
prove it. But in most cases, they can't.
That means you can legally dispute it
and delete them. Not hide them, not
negotiate them, erase them. Now, moving
Paying collections the wrong way can drop your credit score
on to truth number two. Paying
collections the wrong way can drop your
credit score. This next part is going to
truly blow your mind, and I don't think
that enough people talk about it because
paying a collection the wrong way can
actually lower your credit score. And
you're probably saying, "But why? I'm
paying the debt." Because once you pay
it, it updates the collection to paid,
but keeps it on the credit report for 
years. Lenders still see it. Algorithms
still punish it. But here's the kicker.
If you disputed it properly and had
removed it, it'd be like it never
existed. That's the real power. Removal
is greater than a payment. Because
listen, I'm never going to tell you,
"Oh, don't pay your debts. You don't
have to pay those debts." No, that's not
what I'm saying here. You have to
understand something very clearly. If
you pay it and it's not deleted, it's
still hurting your credit score because
it still has the status of collection or
charge off. Paying it does not help your
credit score in any way, shape, or form.
You have to delete it. Moving on to
Challenge the legitimacy of collections
truth number three. You can challenge
the legitimacy of the debt. Every
collection must be backed by paperwork
that proves the next three things. They
own the debt. You owe the exact amount.
They're legally allowed to collect it.
If they can't do all that, you can fire
off a debt validation letter under the
FDCPA, which is the Fair Debt
Collector's Practices Act. And this
forces them to prove it. And here's the
truth. Most of them can't. They'll fold.
They'll delete it. They'd rather walk
away than get sued for violations. But
here's the thing. You don't want to send
some old outdated debt validation letter
from the one that's been
circulating all over every social media
platform. You want to request the
purchase agreement signed by all parties
involved. Now, let's put this letter up
on the screen. I showed it in another
video because it's very powerful and a
lot of people don't understand because
you keep asking for something that
doesn't exist. A lot of people say,
"Show me a wet signature. I want to see
the original contract with the wet
signature." Again, you're asking for
something that doesn't exist. But pay
attention to what this letter says. I
notice you are attempting to collect the
listed alleged debt. I hereby dispute
the validity of the alleged debt listed
below entirely. I also request
verification of the alleged debt,
specifically a copy of the original
purchase agreement. Agreement must be
with the original creditor and signed by
all parties involved. I am requesting
this because I have had different
companies reach out to me about the same
alleged debt. That whole paragraph is
very powerful and people never use this
to their advantage. And the second part
is even more powerful. I'm requesting
immediate deletion of all prior
reporting made to any consumer reporting
agency, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion,
and Anovvice. You must cease collection
efforts until the alleged debt is
validated. You must show proof that you
legally own this alleged debt and that
it is accurate and complete and then
sincerely you put your name, your date
of birth if you want to, your mailing
address. You can just put your mailing
address and listen, it doesn't matter if
you sign it. I don't give a damn what
all these amateurs on social media
saying they're going to take your
signature and they're going to transfer
it over to It's not true. Okay? Those
are amateurs that don't do credit repair
saying that. We've never seen that done.
Okay? And I'm not saying it's not
possible, but I'm just telling you, I've
been doing this now for years, and
we've never seen that nonsense. You can
sign it or you can just print it.
Whatever you choose, it doesn't matter.
It's not that serious. Now, moving on to
You might not owe it anymore
truth number four. You might not even
owe it anymore. Yes, you heard that.
Because this is another thing they pray
you never learn. Debts expire. Every
state has a statute of limitation,
usually to years, where they can no
longer sue you after the statute of
limitations has expired. Literally, they
can still call, they can still send
letters, still report it, but legally,
they can't do a thing in court once time
is up. This is what we call a timebar
debt. Don't restart the clock by making
a payment or admitting to the debt.
Silence is strategy. And you can
literally go on Google and type in
statute of limitations for debt in
California, statute of limitations for
debt in Georgia, and it will come up and
tell you what the statute of limitations
is per your state. So you can know if
this debt is time barred and you can no
longer be sued. And before you come into
the questions and you ask me, well, when
does the debt clock start? The debt
clock starts days after your first
missed payment that caused you to become
delinquent. That's what's called the
first date of delinquency. You can only
find that on your credit report at
annualcreditreport.com,
which is % free if you want to pull
your credit reports there. I want to
give a special shout out to all my
beasters out there that are working hard
to fix their credit using disputebeast,
the most advanced AI credit repair
software ever created that comes with a
% money back guarantee. But
specifically to Louise, Luis's credit
score went up points after just one
round with Dispute Beast and Jensie.
Jensen's credit score went up points
after just one round with Dispute Beast.
But let's not forget James. James'
credit score went up points after
just one round with Dispute Bees.
Dispute Bee's link is going to be in the
video description and pinned at the top
of the comments for anyone that needs to
fix their credit. Now, moving on to
You have rights
truth number five. You have rights they
won't tell you about. Of course, they
won't tell you about them. Debt
collectors love playing dirty. Always
remember this one golden rule. Debt
collectors lie % of the time. Debt
collectors love playing dirty. Harassing
calls, threats, embarrassment. But guess
what? Under the FTCPA, they cannot do
the following things: call you before
a.m. or after p.m. Harass or
threaten you. Talk to your boss or
family about the alleged debt. Lie about
what you owe. If they do any of this,
you can sue them and win $or more
in damages per violation. Your rights
are power, but only if you know them.
And understand something. If you're
going to sue them, I would highly
suggest that you sue them in small
claims court because going through the
legal process with an attorney is very
lengthy and very exhausting. And a lot
of these attorneys don't really like to
fight against debt collectors. Just
keeping it with you. And at the end
of the day, all of these consumer law
attorneys all talk a big game. At the
end of the day, they don't really want
to go up against debt collectors because
it's a lot of paperwork and it cost them
a lot of money. Unless they know they
have a solid case with % proof, you
ain't got nothing. I'm going to be
honest with you. Okay? So, understand
it. That's why it's important if you
have the proof, sue them in small claims
court. Save yourself the headache of
even dealing with an attorney when you
can do it on your own. Now, for the most
important part, how to remove the
collections the right way. There are
going to be five very important steps in
this part right here. So, here's how you
do it the right way. Step number one,
you're going to pull all three credit
reports from Experian, Equifax, and
TransUnion. They're all % free from
annualcreditreport.com.
But also, don't forget to pull the
secondary credit reporting agencies
also. And you can also get those reports
for free from Lexus, Nexus, LCI,
Anovvice, ARS, Credco, Clarity, Data X,
Microbuilt, and Factor Trust. You need
to attack it everywhere. Do not freeze
the secondary credit reporting agencies
because then you're going to leave them
there and then when they delete it from
the big three credit reporting agencies,
it's going to pop back on your credit
report. That's why things come back
after they're deleted because you did
not eradicate it everywhere. So
remember, there's no point in freezing
them. You must attack the secondary
credit reporting agencies. If you don't
do that, you're wasting your time.
Number two, we're going to send a debt
validation letter to the collection
company. Very simple. I gave you the
letter earlier. But you're also going to
dispute the collection with the credit
bureaus, every single one of them. And
you're going to send the exact same debt
validation letter to the credit bureaus.
I know a lot of people say, "What?" Yes.
send that exact same letter to the
credit bureaus. And number four, if no
response in days, demand removal. And
number five, report violations to the
CFPB. The CFPB only has employees
currently working there, but they are
still in fact working. So, you can file
a complaint. Now, remember, you have to
dispute first because a CFPB is a
complaint center. It's not a disputing
platform. Once you've disputed, then you
upload your complaint into the CFPB
system with your proof of the letters
that you sent and the response that you
got from the credit bureaus, the
collection companies, whoever it may be,
and they didn't actually give you proof.
Last part's the most important. Now, the
big question is, but what happens, Mike,
if they send me proof? They're not going
to send you proof. I've been doing this
for a long time, and I've never seen
them send a purchase agreement. Because
when the debt is purchased, it's
purchased all together in one big debt
ball. It's thousands, possibly hundreds
of people's different debts. And by law,
they cannot show you the other debts of
other people under the FDCPA. And yes,
this is a lot of work. I get it. So, if
you want it done faster and handled for
you, you can use Dispute Beast, the most
advanced AI credit repair software ever
created that comes with a % money
back guarantee. And it's % mobile
friendly, meaning you can literally fix
your credit from your phone with no need
for a computer or a printer. And before
you ask me, yes, Dispute Beast attacks
all of the credit reporting agencies,
all of them that we just talked
about. And it also attacks the creditors
also. Link is going to be in the video
description and pinned at the top of the
comments for anyone that needs to use
Dispute Beast to fix their credit. I'm
going to leave you with this last
thought. I want you to understand
something. They are banking on your
ignorance. The less you know, the more
you pay. This is the moment to flip
power back into your hands. 
whatever works best for you
