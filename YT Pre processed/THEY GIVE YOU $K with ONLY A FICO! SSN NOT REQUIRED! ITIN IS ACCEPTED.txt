THEY GIVE YOU $K with ONLY A FICO! SSN NOT REQUIRED! ITIN IS ACCEPTED!
Â I'm going to be
sharing with you where you can get
$for your business and you don't
even have to have the best credit score
So in today's video we're going to be
reviewing Action Opportunity Fund small
business loans that work for you They
also support ITIN only borrowers Now
actually an opportunity fund is one of
the largest CDFIS So CDFI stand for
community development financial
institution Now CDFIs are absolute gems
because the underwriting requirements
are going to be much easier versus the
big banks or even credit unions for that
matter So they're going to have looser
underwriting They're going to be able to
offer extremely low interest rates
compared to the commercial banks Now
Loan Details
action opportunity fund offers loan
amounts from a minimum of all the
way up to And this is affordable
capital with transparent terms and no
prepayment penalty They offer interest
rates as low as % They can offer
different rates that vary based on which
repayment plan you prefer Now what makes
Axion Opportunity Fund different so
they're here to support you and provide
you with resources your business needs
to thrive They are a nonprofit lender So
because they don't exist to make profit
they use the money from your repayment
to support other business owners They
offer customized loans and repayment
terms because no two businesses are
alike Now as I mentioned the great thing
about CDFIS is that they don't really
look at your credit score right so
you're more than just a number So they
look at more than just your credit score
to determine your business viability So
the first step is you can apply online
And the great thing is that you can get
a quote without impacting your credit
score The second step is to review your
offer And step three is to finalize your
loan So once you've chosen an offer
they'll ask for final documentation to
verify They'll review and come back to
you with a final offer and a loan
agreement And upon signing the loan
agreement you'll get the money you need
for your business in your bank account
In addition to loans they also provide
personalized business coaching mentoring
and a comprehensive business resource
library where you can find all the
information you need Now to get started
and get a quote for a loan you just
click this button right here get started
and it'll open up the application All
right So at the top has a summary of the
business and the details as well as the
financing So how much you actually
earned in So the business revenue
and then right here it says please note
that by clicking the submit loan
application you are consenting to allow
action opportunity fund to conduct a
soft pull of your credit in order to
provide you with offers This means that
a request to review your offers will not
affect your credit
Loan Options
score All right so it says just one
moment All right so it says you've been
pre-qualify for the loan options
Congratulations All right so right here
they give three different loan options
for
$So these are just slightly
different terms Now as you can see with
the shorter term there's a interest rate
of With the months it's 
And with the -month it's There
is a
% origination fee so just keep that
in mind Now right down here pretty much
just breaks down the loan details Now
right here it says not satisfied with
these options You can contact one of the
loan officers to get more information on
your options All right so let's just
walk through some of these different
loan options So the total loan amount is
And so this is going to be
monthly payments of
$The interest rate is
$% There is a % origination fee
So the total repayment after it's all
said and done So this is going to be
paid back after one full year So the
total repayment is going to be
$So again how they have this
sort of laid out So again the shorter
term is going to have the lowest overall
cost So you are going to have a high
monthly payment as it says right here
But in terms of total interest that
you're paying is going to be the lowest
overall cost And then when you're
looking at the -month term this is
going to be the lowest monthly payment
However since you do hold the loan for
longer you will be subject to more
interest and actually the interest rates
increase from to So again
this is the same $loan except
this is out to years or months
versus months And the monthly payment
is going to be much lower Again same
origination fee no prepayment penalty
The total repayment is going to be
$So again actually an opportunity
Conclusion
fund is a community development
financial institution They're also a
c nonprofit lender Now the trade-off
with using CDFIS and nonprofit lenders
is that of course you're going to have
lower underwriting requirements So even
if you don't have the best credit score
even if your income isn't the highest
you can still qualify Because of that
the process usually tends to be a little
bit more drawn out and they are usually
going to require additional
documentation So this isn't like an
instant approval type of situation Now
in comparison let's say you were go to a
major bank or even some credit unions
Usually the underwriting criteria is
going to be higher especially in today's
current economic times where even a lot
of credit unions are now asking for tax
returns and requiring you to have over a
credit score Now with action
opportunity fund you have a credit score
as low as a Overall I think CDFI's
community development financial
institutions are one of the most
underutilized financial resources
There's literally thousands of CDFIs
across the country Now if anyone is
interested in researching a CDFI in
their local area I've dropped the CDFI
locator link in the description of the
video Also Axion Opportunity Fund is
available in states so you can check
their website to make sure that your
state is one of the eligible states
before you submit a pre-qualification
