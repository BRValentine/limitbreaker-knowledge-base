NEW $K EASY APPROVAL LINE OF CREDIT! LOW INCOME AND BAD FICO ACCEPTED! GRADUATE TO UNSECURED FAST!
we're
going to be going over the Bank of
America cash secured line of credit Now
this is different from their traditional
secured business line of credit and the
requirements are much easier So if
you're a newer business you can still
qualify for that But before we dive into
this I just wanted to differentiate from
their actual secured business line of
Traditional Secured Business Line of Credit Requirements
credit So Bank of America has always had
their secured business line of credit
Now the secured business line of credit
you still had to meet certain criteria
So right here minimum years in
business under existing ownership and a
minimum of
$in annual revenue So their
traditional secured business line of
credit knocks a lot of small businesses
or even newer businesses out of the game
because for one you need to be in
business for at least years and you
need to be generating
$Now the cash secured line of
Differences Between Traditional and Cash Secured Lines of Credit
credit is a little bit different So with
the cash secured line of credit you can
build and strengthen your credit while
growing your business So this is going
to be for small businesses with at least
in annualized revenue and 
months in business So as you can see the
requirements are much more lenient than
their traditional secure business line
of credit You only need to have 
versus
in months time in business
versus two years time in business Now
now right here it says graduate to an
unsecured line over time security
deposit starting at $So the
minimum to put down is and you can
graduate to an unsecured business line
of credit over time So the path to the
Steps to Graduate to an Unsecured Line of Credit
unsecured line of credit first you're
going to apply online So you apply and
fund your account with a minimum deposit
of $And then number two you're
going to keep growing your business So
use your line of credit for operating
expenses payroll and make regular
payments to establish positive account
history And then step three graduate to
an unsecured line So after a successful
review of your account performance your
deposit will be refunded Account reviews
begin at months So you could
essentially graduate from a secured cash
line of credit to an unsecured business
line of credit within months So when
you make regular on-time payments to
build your business credit after years
in business under existing ownership and
in annual revenue you can
transition to an unsecured line of
credit Your credit line is also
refundable So if your primary goal is to
build business credit your small
business can start with a security
deposit as low as And you could
close the account at any time simply by
paying off the balance Once the account
has been closed your security deposit
will be refunded Now again the minimum
line amount is $And this does come
with a $annual fee but this is waved
for the first year So if you eventually
transition to an unsecured account then
it's not going to cost you anything
because again it's waved in the first
year and you come up for review to an
unsecured card after the first months
There's also no origination fees Now
Comparison of Different Line of Credit Options
let's compare some of the different line
of credit options right so you have your
business advantage credit line So this
is going to be the unsecured account And
then you have the business advantage
credit line cash secured So you do have
to put down cash to secure the account
Now with the other secured line of
credit you don't necessarily have to
secure it with cash You can secure it
with business assets But again that's
for more established businesses Now when
comparing these accounts right so again
for the unsecured account years time
in business for the cash secured line of
credit only months Minimum sales is
going to be and the prior annual
gross sales And this is for the
unsecured For the secured is going to be
The cash secured business line of
credit also has a path to graduation to
an unsecured option So again this is a
way for you to transition from secured
to unsecured Now some of the top
Frequently Asked Questions
frequently asked questions How is my
credit line determined the credit line
amount is equal to the cash security
deposit that you provide The minimum
required deposit is
$Also how do I graduate to an
unsecured line of credit so they will
periodically evaluate your cash secured
line of credit for eligibility for an
unsecured business advantage credit line
When you meet lending standards for the
unsecured line of credit they will
refund your security deposit Now I also
just wanted to distinguish the cash
secured line of credit versus the
secured business line of credit These
are two different products So the
requirements for the secured business
line of credit again minimum annual
revenue of
and at least years under the
current owner business ownership Now
Recap and Final Thoughts
just to recap so Bank of America now
offers three different business lines of
credit So they have the traditional
unsecured business line of credit that
requires two years time in business and
then you also have the secured business
line of credit that also requires two
years time in business but also
$in annual revenue Now with the
cash secured line of credit this is
going to be open for newer businesses
that are at least months old and have
in annual gross revenues Now this
is going to open the door for a lot of
small businesses because one of the big
complaints I hear all the time is that a
lot of businesses can't get access to
business lines of credit because they
don't have those two years time in
business or usually years of business
tax returns to qualify at most
commercial banks So overall I think this
is a gamecher by Bank of America cuz not
only will you have access to a line of
credit a business line of credit that
will help you with building your
business credit And what's also unique
is that this cash secured line of credit
also has a path to graduation So you
could eventually transition to an
unsecured line of credit where you
actually get your security deposit back
and also potentially get a credit limit
increase Now from my understanding this
may be one of the only secured business
lines of credit or cash secured lines of
credit on the business side that have a
path to graduation Now one of the
differences between a secured business
line of credit versus a secured credit
card for example is that with a secured
business line of credit you're able to
withdraw or draw down on the full amount
of the line of credit So it's
essentially just the same as almost
having money in your checking account So
you have full access to the funds So
even though you're putting down the
deposit you still have % access You
can pull the entire amount off So
overall I think this is an absolute
gamecher especially for newer businesses
to not only build business credit also
have access to your money and build a
banking relationship with one of the top
financial institutions in the country

may still ask you for your credit
history but they may not use it to
determine your eligibility a lot of
times it's just trying to get to know
who you are and with the to 
different lenders that I look at these
are the four that are awesome for this
situation the first one I've got for you
is called Kaa K IA Kaa is unique in that
it uses a crowdfunding like all of you
platform that specialized in providing
small business loans without a minimum
credit score required they pull little a
little money from a little bit from
everybody and they offer a more
inclusive opportunity for entrepreneurs
who may not meet the criteria for
traditional loans based on credit score
because we determine based on that crowd
funding with a maximum funding limit of
$Kaa caters particularly well to
businesses with a modern modest startup
expenses the platform operates on a
peer-to-peer that's like you and me
right like that's how it works Lending
model where borrowers engage their
personal networks people you even know
to secure the initial funding within
-day period so you'll put it out your
friends and family can be part of this
pool and then they'll launch it to
everybody followed by this phase of
going to your personal Network Kea
broadens the scope by introducing the
campaign to a network of lenders
facilitating the acquisition of these
microloans critical for business
operations to your friends and family
can help you get loans from lenders
because that they're putting a little
bit in and these lenders go you know
what if they trust you I think we'll
trust you one of aa's distinguishing
features is its transparency regarding
business credit reports lenders on the
platform do not have access to borrowers
business credit reports nor is that
information publicly displayed to the
borrowers that ke a loan profile so
you're not going to be found out by all
your friends about you know your score
this approach offers a level of privacy
for you focused on the business idea and
the borrowers Network support rather
than strict credit matters it's a social
lending platform it only happens now in
this crazy social media Road right to
qualify for Kea loans applications must
be years and older and have their own
business operation in the United States
these are for US citizens and US
businesses loan amounts can reach up to
that $and repayment terms can be
over a period of years offering
flexibility in managing your loan
obligations so that you can afford the
monthly payment now Kea stands out as a
viable funding option for small
businesses emphasizing community support
and your friends will know that you're
in business accessibility and
flexibility as far as those loan terms
and paying it back the next one I've got
to talk about is credibility and and
this is spelled credit Billy yeah c r e
d i b l y and it offers small business
loans with a reli relatively low minimum
credit score requiring of that's
pretty low right although applicants
should be aware that the lower credit
score May still lead to a higher
interest rate again Kaa isn't looking at
credit this one to get in this club
this accessibility Factor makes credible
an appealing option for borrowers
concerned about traditional lending
stricter credit criterias because
they've lowered the bar to be able to
let you in and get this you're not going
to believe the amounts the amounts I
think are wild from $to $,
providing stability stable financial
support for businesses of all varying
scales who couldn't use
$well we just funded that last
Saturday we Angel funded a business
which we're really excited about tilt
which is cool so anyway that's another
that's another video besides credit
scores credible evaluates the overall
Financial Health of the business during
the application process considering
factors that are Beyond just the credit
score requirements they want to know
more however to qualify businesses must
determine a consistent monthly cash flow
you got to have
$showcasing Financial stability
and repayment capacity meaning you got
to have some cash flow now eligibility
requirements for credible loans include
being based in the United States
maintaining a credit score of and
higher and ensuring that that minimum
monthly Revenue hits that threshold of
$that's the total amount you
could be paying out in expenses
but you got to have coming in
loan terms offered by credibility spam
from to months allowing borrowers
flexibility and managing the repayment
schedule according to business cash flow
and of course your specific needs
credible emphasis on businesses health
and cash flow provides a path for
businesses to access that necessary
capital and funding to grow your
operation and help with whatever your
needs are they're there to help you next
up we got to talk about one of my
favorites we love this this came out of
Elon Musk Empire PayPal PayPal's working
capital loan stands out at its unique
repayment structure making it a
practical choice for businesses
leveraging PayPal as a payment platform
and I bet you soon X will be providing
loans I'm just saying elans always
wanted to be the bank of banks the
digital bank so we'll see if he
accomplished that but PayPal their loan
repayment integrates with your sales
revenue on PayPal they're able to see
like what your selling the payment
platform automatically deducts a
percentage of your sales until the loan
is cleared so you don't even have to
worry about like making a payment
they'll just take it out of what your
sales are so easy and seamless PayPal
accessibility eligibility for this is
based on your PayPal Salle history
rather than conducting a traditional
credit check offering accessibility from
the wide range of borrowers they just
look at like are you selling on PayPal
because they're making a little bit on
whatever you're selling right so they
give you working capital that entails
repaying a minimum of to or % of
the total loan amount along with a fixed
fee every days until the loan is
fully repaid you also are able to keep
the flexibility to make additional
payments at any time without incurring
uh prepayment penalties like if you're
paid off early upon approval of the
application and the agreement of terms
funding and depositing into your PayPal
account see it streamlines the entire
buing process like it's just so simple
just shows up there it's amazing and to
qualify for this loan businesses must
have a PayPal account premium or a
business account that you got to be
around for at least days ensuring the
stability of history with the platform
that's only days so if you're not
started start Additionally the annual
PayPal Sals must meet specific
thresholds with a minimum of $
for Premium Accounts and for
business accounts the loan amounts range
from to initially with the
potential for a higher amount of 
for repeat lenders now the last one I'm
going to talk about is an amazing one I
love them they've been around for a
while they are square you can get a loan
with square which is pretty amazing
square loans offer a convenient and
accessible Financial option for
businesses using Square and like PayPal
square is squaring up the deal right
with it sets Square loans apart is that
they automatically repay they have a
repayment system where a small portion
of your daily sales from Square accounts
goes back to repaying the loan balance
so you don't feel it right this seamless
process it eliminates the need for
manual payments and keeps constant
progress towards that debt clearance as
well as not messing up your credit cuz
they're going to take care of you unlike
traditional loans that look at your
credit score Square considers various
business factors such as your account
history processing volume and your
payment fre fre quency to determine
eligibility now to qualify for square
loans businesses must be active a square
seller leveraging Square payment
processing and of course they're making
a little bit of money off that loan
amounts range from bucks to
accommodating businesses of
different sizes and of course whatever
your financial needs are these loans are
structured with a flat fee rather than
ongoing interest payments to make
payments considerable so they make it
simple and you can see it and you can
understand it pretty easily Square loans
do not entail late fees or additional
hidden charges making it easier for
people to borrow money and actually
trust them it's almost like the Costco
approach right the repayment timeline
for square loans requires full repayment
in months offering a reasonable time
frame for businesses to manage and clear
those debt obligations so that you can
get rid of them now this structured
approach aligns with business cash flow
Revenue cycles that keep going like
monthly maintaining Financial so it does
does strain you and it supports your
stable growth here so that they can grow
your business the idea is that they give
you Capital when you need it even though
you don't know that you need it they
actually give you the access so you can
start buying more stuff to sell right
overall when you're shopping around for
small business loans and have a higher
credit score with that that you can
qualify there might be favorable rates
and terms for those type of loans
although if you have a low credit score
it isn't the end of the world these are
the places to go and they're more that
I'll cover if you stick around on the
channel and if you PR prefer to shop
with lenders right that don't run your
credit check you still have options
