Eliminate Student Loans, IRS & Child Support
are you currently struggling with IRS debt student loans or child support on your personal credit reports and you
just don't know what to do because it's weighing heavily on your FICO score Well in this video I'm going to share with you exactly how to get rid of all of
these things off of your personal credit so that you can drastically increase your FICO score In addition to that you
can actually permanently remove this debt from your person once and for all So there's three vastly different ways
of handling this kind of debt And in this video I'm going to share with you exactly how that works So let's get into it
[Music]
So let's talk about student loans One in five adults currently right now in the
United States is in debt with student debt In fact it's over a trillion dollars that people just like you and me
are holding with student debt just for the mere purpose of trying to get a better education to try to get a better
job And so that's what's so disheartening about this whole thing is that the system has become a money-making grab with a purpose and
intent of making money off of you for your student loan in the in interest And
so they're basically raking people over the coals for the simple mere fact of basically trying to go out there and do
better for yourself And so what do you do if you're struggling with student debt Well the answer is probably not the
one that you might want to hear but I have a couple of different options for you to get it permanently p pulled off your personal credit report so that it's
no longer affecting your FICO score And it's going to be kind of a journey but
at the same time it's going to be well worth it So for those of you that are struggling with student loans right now that are damaging your personal credit
you're going to want to listen to everything I have to tell you In fact there is a loophole that you can have some of this debt actually permanently
removed without having to pay for it at all Now you have to take into account what kind of loan or loans are we
dealing with here Most of the loans out there to the tune of % are federal loans or federal backed loans Only % of
student debt is they're private loans So what do you have And you're going to
have to figure it out Most people like I just mentioned % actually have federal or federal backed loans And so if that's
the case that's kind of a problem because that stuff sticks around forever In fact in many cases you can't even
file for bankruptcy against those loans unless of course you have certain circumstances that apply So let's get
into exactly how to have the stuff removed What's the best course of action to take and what some of the loopholes
are to actually have the debt permanently removed without actually paying for it So let's talk about the option of getting it under control and
you know taking the bull by the horns and taking some responsibility for this because as much as we'd like to and complain about how unfair the system
is the reality is those loans were taken out and you did or maybe you didn't complete your degree I don't know what
the personal situation is that you have but regardless of whether you finished your degree or not you do have to pay
that loan back Unless of course you can prove that number one the school that
you were going to and attending to is permanently closed and you were unable to finish your degree in which case you
can actually have the entire loan discharge without further paying for it Or if you were misled by the school
maybe it was a shim shammy type of school um maybe like a Trump University kind of thing if you know what I mean
and maybe they just weren't legit and they may they were not above board in which case you can actually have the
entire thing thrown out and not have to pay another dime on that loan Most people though are not going to find
themselves in those situations And so you need to think in terms of okay well what other situation can I possibly
qualify for that can get these loans permanently thrown out without me paying another penny toward them Well there's
other situations and circumstances that you might want to dig into And of course I don't know you personally so I
wouldn't know whether this applies to you or not But if you are a teacher you could potentially have those loans
permanently shoved off your personal credit and not have to pay any more money to them Again this this just depends on your personal situation if
you're a government employee if you work for a nonprofit if you're a nurse doctor or other medical practitioner um if you
have a disability or if you have and only know those of you that know uh you
know kind of what whether or not you were part of the income based repayment plan which is the IBR plan if you know
that you are part of that then there are situations where you can actually have these loans permanently pushed off your
personal credit reports without paying any more money but only you know whether or not you qualify for any of those
categories And if you don't well then you're probably going to be on the hook for these loans Now here's the thing A
lot of people don't understand that there is a way to reset the debt So if you have been struggling and for example
if these are federally backed loans I'm going to warn you right now that you are going to be in default if it's a
federally backed loan if you have not paid it for days Okay Sometimes they are a little more lenient depending on
of course whether or not you actually were participating in the onhold pandemic plan where you basically got a
pause on your student loans Otherwise it it will actually start to kick in as far
as a default after days and then of course it will start to report as late
to the credit bureaus after days Okay that's for the % of you who actually
have federal loans Okay Now for the % of you that actually have private student loans then you're going to be
looking at late pays just like any other credit card or loan payment after days In days they'll actually throw
you into default So you need to figure out where you're at Now here's the good news If you have more than one student
loan meaning multiple student loans which you can do is actually go to studentaid.gov
and I will have it down below in the description box Again it's studentaid.gov and you can actually get
a consolidation loan you can pull all your loans together into one loan and start the process all over again So this
typically kind of works I don't know if you've ever had the experience many of you have where you go to a car dealership you turn your trade in and
maybe you still owe money on a lease or on a um you know a financed vehicle And
so what ends up happening is that the dealership will pay off that loan and then open up a new loan for you for the
new vehicle So this works the same way where if you have say three loans three student loans and you decide to take on
a new loan for the consolidation then what'll happen is on your credit reports it'll show that those three loans were
paid off in full and it'll look good on your credit It'll actually boost your FICO score and then there'll be a new loan that'll open up for the
consolidation part of this If you can pull that off and if you have the income to do it and if you're not going to be
bitching and complaining about not wanting to pay your bills and not wanting to pay your you know student loans which I'm hoping that since you
did benefit from the student loans that you want to pay it back and you want to make good on it then this is the best
route to take So then once you do this part again you go to studentaid.gov
you can actually do the whole thing on their website And they're a lot more lenient than you think because some
people are like "Oh I don't know Monica you know my uh FICO score is you know in the toilet and blah blah blah whatever the case may be And you might be
thinking well I don't know if I could qualify Well they want you to repay this loan They want to do what they can to
get you to repay this loan which means that if it means consolidating the loans that you have and starting over from a
clean slate with a brand new account then they will do that despite what your current financial and FICO score
situation is So I highly recommend that you do it that way Now once you do the consolidation process then what you want
to do is start the process of the dispute process with the credit reporting bureaus which is Experian Equifax and TransUnion So if they did
not update the accounts as paid or showing that they're favorable on your account or your your profile right now
with Experian Equifax and TransUnion then you're going to want to dispute that because it's now considered inaccurate information Those loans have
been fully paid through the debt consolidation through studentgov and therefore it should not show as late or
you know basically anything Now of course it will show that maybe you were days late or days late or days late or whatever the case may be but it
will show as a closed paid in full account which is going to reflect good on your credit reports even if it's
showing late Now a lot of times what a lot of things what a lot of times when you do the dispute process a lot of
people don't realize is that when they do the dispute process sometimes there's a glitch in the system which I love when
this happens where you actually do a physically mailedin dispute I don't like to do online disputes at all because I
find that they're ineffective They don't work But if you want to send in a physical letter I have free disputelet
letters You get them down below Getdisputers.com People try to put the www part in there They don't get to the
website They freak out So don't put the www part in there Just go to a browser and type in getdisputletters.com
Without the www part and you'll be able to get my free dispute letters and you basically print them out You mail one
into Experian one to Equifax one to TransUnion ideally with trackable USPS
mail It doesn't have to be certified Doesn't have to be priority You don't have to spend the extra money on that Just make sure it's trackable that you
get a tracking number to make sure you know the date that they receive it And so what ends up happening as you go
through the dispute process they do an investigation realize that the account has been paid in full And therefore not
only would the account be updated to reflect positively on your credit but they might also remove all those late as
well And sometimes that's a glitch in the system and it's a glitch that's worth trying for by doing this dispute
process So that'll clean that part up Now you'll have a new consolidated one
lumpsum student loan that you're dealing with and make good on it Make a commitment to make the minimum monthly
payment because you want the stuff to start reflecting positively on your
credit and it'll actually start to boost your FICO score and help you in exponential ways if you just play the
credit game Okay Very very simple very easy to do So okay Well what happens if
you can't pay Well if you can't pay then you need to start the process of going
through the list that I talked about before and find out And the list is the complete list is on studentaid.gov on
who qualifies exactly to have the stuff permanently removed without paying another dime See if you qualify You'd be
surprised Maybe you do qualify to have the debt thrown out completely without paying any more money And if that's the
case then go for it You can actually do the full application online at studentaid.gov Down below in the
description box you'll find that information And I would apply because you never know Listen a lot of people
don't understand this whole system is so inundated The these staff members in these different organizations especially
government organizations are up to their eyeballs in work They're they're working tirelessly they're you know they're
overworked underpaid and a lot of these departments have cut back And so you'd
be shocked and amazed at how much progress you can make by either asking for a consolidation loan or just simply
putting in an application to have the whole thing thrown out because they don't really have a lot of time to do
the full research and rundown on exactly whether or not you qualify And sometimes there's a glitch in that system as well
where you can literally have something thrown out that maybe you thought was impossible to throw out and you never know until you try So go to that website
and try to have the damn thing thrown out Now maybe you want to start off with that first if you know that you don't have the ability to repay it and then
think about debt consolidation options at that same website link if in fact you can't get it thrown out if you don't
qualify So I would try that first if I were you If I was having you know problems because just based on the low
income if you're dealing with a low-inccome situation you might actually qualify to have the whole thing thrown out anyway just based on that So that's
how you do that So after you do your first round of disputes whether or not you actually are able to consolidate or
if you did the application to have it thrown off um by the way if you also have an identity theft situation I did
another video on doing a police report if you did have an ID theft situation you might even be able to get your
student ID or your student loan thrown off just be based on ID theft And so you
can even potentially furnish your police report either to both studentaid.gov in
addition to the the U credit reporting bureaus basically stating hey this isn't
my debt or I had a situation with ID theft here's the here's the report the police report that you want to get from
the detective after they initially write it up which takes about two to three days after they write up your report
Then you might even be able to get it thrown off as well because that's another loophole with studentaid.gov
where you can actually have your debt removed if you can show proof of of ID theft And so you can also try that as
well In addition to that you could send that into the credit reporting bureaus saying "Hey I had ID theft This needs to
be removed." and it can be removed off of your credit reports I have a new
document for you guys at getdisputters.com and you can actually get the letter that
I recommend that you use for the purposes of asking any creditor
collection agency etc for verification or validation of debt which is a federal law And so if you ask for verification
or or validation of the debt which would be the second part so part one would be
the dispute process only after you've dis you've been able to explore the
options to whether whether or not you want to consolidate or try to get the throne off all together You can explore
all of that at studentaid.gov But if you decide well you know I'm going to just go for the dispute process
because I can't do all of this stuff Well then you go through your dispute process like I said And the second part
is to actually demand from the creditor which would be the government
to prove that this is your account This the student loan is your account And you can do this with a brand new letter that
I have which is now at getdisdutlets.com which you can get down below And you can actually use that letter send it by
certified mail So listen folks you know you want to be cheap and lazy and you want to try to do this you know some
other way You're not going to get the results However if you want to do this the way you're supposed to I recommend
you do an envelope The envelope does not have to be this big by the way It can be a number regulariz business envelope
But you can clearly see that this is certified which means you have to need to walk into the post office and actually have somebody behind the
counter you know do this transaction for you This is what a certified card looks like And I always have so many of you
argue with me Monica you know hardly any of these cards come back Really out of all the years I've been doing this I've
sent out thousands of these cards I think I only had one that didn't come back So you want them to have a wet
signature does not matter if it's going to a PO box Nine times out of it will be And somebody will go up to the counter and sign a bunch of these and
you you'll be one of them And then the postal carrier person or the person behind the counter at the post office rips this off of this envelope and mails
this back to you And then now you have a wet signature of them receiving your validation of debt letter And basically
what the letter says which I have a new template at getdisputters.com you can get that put that in this
envelope and say as per federal law you do have to validate this debt upon my request And the validation needs to be
some kind of proof of a contract agreement etc And it needs to be signed So it
can't be just some typed in you know somebody's name or it can't just be here's a statement Believe it or not did
you know that I can actually I can go on my QuickBooks system right now and I can generate a statement that claims that
you owe me a million dollars Just because somebody sends you a statement or an invoice in the mail does not mean you owe it Okay But a contract that has
some kind of signature on it or some kind of agreement that is what you're looking for with the verification of
debt or validation of debt And so as per federal law and all the case law is cited in that letter you can put that in
this envelope and they have days from the date that they sign this to get that
validation of debt to you Okay Now what happens if they don't send you anything Well then you send a copy of this card
and a copy of the letter that was in this envelope to Experian Equifax and TransUnion and you say "Hey I sent this
to them on X date." They signed for it on X date It's been more than days and they have not sent me a valid you
know agreement They have not sent me anything as per federal law That's that that's clearly stated in the letter what
what they're supposed to send me They didn't send me that Now what if they did send you something What if they sent you I don't know just some statement like I
said or some kind of invoice that doesn't have your name on there I don't admit to receiving anything Okay because
technically you did not receive what they are supposed to send you by federal
law So if they did send you a statement don't confuse the process Don't confuse the minimum wage person who's opening up
these envelopes and trying to process these different disputes by saying "Yes
I received something but it was the wrong thing." Because all they're going to see is "Yes I received something."
Okay They're not going to read the rest of it or care what the hell you have to say beyond "I received something." So
what you want to say in your letter to the reporting bureaus which is again Experian Equifax and TransUnion you want
to say "I sent this out They signed it Here's a copy of this card showing that they signed it on this date It's been
more than days Here's the letter I gave them asking for validation of debt As per federal law they are required to
give this to me They've given me nothing that validates the debt which would be true because if they send you a
statement that is not that doesn't count That is not a validation of debt If they
send you an invoice that is not a validation of debt If they send you some kind of paperwork that has somebody's type name in there that doesn't count
either So what you want to say is "No I did not receive validation of debt as per federal law." And that's %
correct That's a truthful statement that you're making because you didn't receive that A statement is not that statement is not a promisary note or agreement or
a contract That's nothing Right So that's how you want to treat that And
you know there's a good chance that you might be able to get the student debt off there now does that mean that they can't sue you People ask me this all the
time They're like Monica well just because I have it removed off my credit report does that mean that they can't you know that that they they can sue me
now right Well did you know that they could sue you anyway They could sue you anyway regardless of whether it crap
stays on your credit report So people have this fear that the second stuff falls off their credit report that suddenly they're going to get sued It's
like well most collection agencies creditors don't waste their time filing lawsuits unless it's more than 
$depending on what they think it's it's worth to be able to go after you And it's almost like trying to
squeeze you know blood from a turnup It's like why would they put all this legal money into this lawsuit you know
over a few thousand dollar debt Most of them don't do that Now most student loan loans are on average about $is
what most people owe with student loans So they might go after you with the lawsuit but just because it's not on your credit report anymore does not mean
that they won't sue you That's just not how it works folks Anybody can sue you for
anything Did you know that your neighbor can sue you because they don't like the color of your house Believe it or not
welcome to the highly litigous society of the United States of America That's what people do So people can sue you for
anything Just because that's on your credit report doesn't mean that you're you know somehow protected from being sued Just because it's not on your
credit report doesn't automatically guarantee that they're going to sue you So that's just how it works So that's
how I would get student loans off I would try to make good on the loans by consolidating by going to studentaid.gov
and seeing what kind of consolidation programs I could participate in and just restart the process and then just make
the commitment to make that monthly payment because you did get the education and you know whether or not
you finished is is not their problem you know you signed for the the debt and it's the best thing to do and it would
help your credit a lot is if you showed your old debt being paid off in full and now having a new loan that you're going
to be making good on every single month it's only going to help your credit not hurt your credit So that's what you want to do in the student loan capacity So
you're like "Okay Monica well that sounds great for student loans but I have IRS debt." So IRS debt is treated
differently And the good news it's actually easier to deal with IRS debt or other tax obligations even state tax
obligations depending on the state of course than it is to deal with student loans believe it or not I know that seems outlandish but it's it's true So
the the strategy that I recommend people to take because most people don't have the capacity to be able to deal with the
IRS directly on their own and that is to try to find an IRS or tax attorney to
help you negotiate this Now you might say "Well Monica I can't afford an attorney." Or whatever the case may be
Well you need to decide am I going to be pennywise pound foolish Because if you owe say I'm just going to pull some
random number Say you owe $to the IRS But if a tax attorney who can
get it down to maybe half that or less would charge you would it be worth it
to pay the tax attorney $to have that debt go from to Well I
would say yes And in some cases they can get it down even more So you got to stop thinking about the pennywise pound
foolish mentality because you have to think in terms of what is my long-term goal here and that is to get the IRS
debt off your back and off your credit And so then that way you can start the process of just having you know a good
FICO score right So if you feel like well I don't know if I could afford it
or my tax obligation is not that much so I don't want to be paying you know $$for an attorney to negotiate
maybe only owe like you know three four $to the IRS So what do you do then when it's sitting on your credit report
Well in that case and I and I urge you to I urge you to try to find a
low-budget attorney that can help you negotiate it but if you absolutely cannot afford it which I understand cuz
you know times are hard now then what you can do is you can call the IRS on the phone Now I know that seems spooky
Don't freak out quite yet because anytime I've ever had to call the IRS usually for some business thing some EIN
in you know issue or whatever the case may be But I've also had students my credit students in particular that will
call the IRS And in all of the instances when I call the IRS this is what I get I
get somebody who's again overworked underpaid They've been you know diminishing these
IRS and other government departments and they're just as tired and fed up with
everything as you are right So you have to understand that you're not dealing with the IRS So get this in your mind
This is a mentality mental shift here for you You're dealing with a person on the other end of that phone right And so
when you think in terms of I'm dealing with a person you think okay what's the best way I can deal with a person How
would I want to be treated Well you want to be treated with respect Okay Don't take out all of the life and times of
your IRS issues on the one person that answers the phone to help you Please don't because it's not going to help you
at all and it's not fair to that person Yes they work for the IRS and the IRS overall sucks but it's again an
individual you're dealing with So my recommendation to you is to be as nice as possible Just say "I've run into some
hard times." Be as forthright as possible because people like honesty And they also understand that people are
going through a hell of a time right now So you just say "I've I've gone through some major you know issues." Maybe I
mean don't go into too much detail but maybe you had a medical problem Maybe you were in a coma for months Maybe
you know you had a car accident and you had to go through physical therapy for six months or a year Explain the situation Just say "I fell behind You
know I know I owe this debt um I would like to pay because IRS debt does not fall off Okay so this is one of those
rare situations where you admit to the debt because you can't get out of it Okay unless you die of course which we
don't want that to happen So we know that you got to pay that right So
knowing that you have to pay that you admit to it say yes I understand that I owe it What can I do to fix the
situation What are my options And then they'll explain well we can set up a payment plan and this and that and this
and that when they roll out the options what's which they're going to roll out for you They're going to say "Well how much do you think you can afford every
month?" And you tell them "Well bucks a month or whatever the case may be." And you might be you know not getting Starbucks that month or whatever the
case may be but everybody can usually scrape together $a month at least maybe even $a month to try to get
this caught up And so what you want to do is even even if you have to go collect cans or whatever go ahead and do
it just to try to get this squared away Now here's the important part to this is that when you are on the phone
negotiating with the IRS yourself just say "I would really love to start the payment plan but I would like it if you
could put it in writing that number one this is our payment plan and this is a the agreed period of time in which I
will be making these payments to cover this agreed debt but I would like to have you take it off my personal
credit." Just say "It's been affecting me I can't get a decent car loan I can't rent an apartment I can't do whatever."
just give them the whole you know crying eyes you know story right And usually what they'll do is they'll say "Okay
well what we'll do is we'll wait till you make like three or four payments in a row without skipping any or being late
on any." And typically what'll happen is yes the IRS will take the entire debt
off your personal credit reports all three of them Okay It works every time
I've had so many people do it this way They don't think it's going to work They're like "I'm dealing with the IRS they don't care blah blah blah That's
not the case Remember what I said mentality shift right You're dealing with an individual when you talk to somebody on the phone And so they are
usually good I know it's a government agency and people are like I don't think they're going to do this They will do it
because they want to get paid just like anybody else And if they know that this little minuscule monthly payment plan is
the only way to start getting you to pay something it's better than nothing And you can also negotiate off all the
interest and all the you know fines and all that other stuff You can also negotiate that down on your own as well
And it would start with a conversation of well what's the core debt Like what's the core tax debt And then you can start
negotiating you know getting rid of all the interest and all the fees and the fines as well And you can do this on
your own Give yourself some credit to be able to handle this on your own
especially if you can't afford an attorney or you don't have a massive tax obligation to whereas you need an
attorney Like if you owe tens of thousands of dollars you probably want to have an attorney involved But if you owe like less than maybe even less
than then you might want to start this strategy and do the strategy See how far you get Now if you get somebody
who completely shuts you down and says "No I'm not doing it this way," or "Screw you," which sometimes you do when you call the IRS Well then you're
probably going to have to consider getting yourself a tax attorney to help you out with the negotiation process and that would be the best step But at least
you tried right So that's how you deal with IRS debt And yes it does work And
yes I know it's scary to call the IRS but remember you're not calling the the nameless faceless boogeyman You are
actually calling an individual who's going to be having a hard day and they're working their ass off and they're just not happy with their job
and they're not happy with the cutbacks and they're thinking that they might get laid off any second now and they're going through their own stuff too They
also know how hard things are in society and how how people are going through hard times And if you are nice to them and you are forthright and honest you'll
be shocked at how far you can get with the IRS Trust me on this okay I know it's hard to trust the government but
trust me on this I've worked with so many people who've been able to pull this off and they're shocked They they get back to me and they're like "Monica
this actually worked." Yeah because you're not dealing with the IRS you're dealing with an individual Now like I
said once in a while you'll get that you know bad apple but for the most part they're pretty good people And I found that the people that work in the IRS are
not only helpful they seem really tired and if you're just willing to extend a little bit of nicity toward them then
they will literally um bend over backwards for you and that's what you want So just be nice damn it Just be
nice you know No need to be be all upset It's not their fault They didn't do this to you So just be as nice as possible
and as honest as possible And that brings me finally to child support Now
this is a loaded topic for me and let me tell you why It's because uh my daughter she will be an adult next year and I
have been a one-man band single parent for the last almost years Okay I
divorced her dad when when she was um not just just under two So he's been a
dead beatat since day one and that's why I got a divorce because he didn't want to get a job And after all the excuses
for years I decided I did not want my daughter to be raised in a household where she saw mommy working her ass off
every day and daddy sitting around and playing video games or watching TV Okay
So I decided that kids pick up what they see rather than what you tell them And
so I decided that I didn't want her to see that And I did not want her to think that that's okay So that's why I filed for divorce So ever since then I am the
one man ban financially for her and he has not put in anything And in addition that in addition to that we were in the
state of California LA County and he probably is hovering around $in
back child support And so this is a loaded topic for me because I have a lot
of men in particular who ask me in the comments section how they can get out of
their child support And I have to be honest with you guys in particular
you know pay for your damn kids okay I mean you help bring them into the world
Pay for them damn kids All right Because I've been fighting this for years And as
far as me getting paid which even the poultry amount that he's actually supposed to be paying as per his court
order is such a small amount compared to what it actually takes to raise a young lady I've kicked in so much money to be
able to get this girl over the finish line And I'm going to continue paying probably well into her adulthood because
things are so difficult for young people to be able to launch into the real world these days We both know that So I have a
sensitive spot And if you can find a way to get back to and communicate with the
baby mama because we know it's mostly the dudes that want to get out of this child support thing then you can start
the negotiation process with her And there's a good chance that you might
be able to have the courts reverse all this crap that's on your personal credit when it comes to child support Some
states will do it some counties will do it Well they'll allow you to have a personal um agreement with the s former
significant other the the the parent of the situation And other counties are just like "Nope sorry You've already
proven to be a dead beat so now it's our problem to rake you over the coals." And they will So see if there's a county if
you're in a county where they will allow you to communicate with the with the baby mama say in this situation
and you need to be able to see if you can get her to agree to some other
payment plan and then the county will then be able to take it off your credit because you could show
some kind of payments But you do have to go through the county though to to make sure that they're taking out taken out
of the situation as a debt collector So you're going to have to do some communication with the county and you
might even have to drag baby mama down there and have to sign whatever paperwork the county requires to whereas
they're going to be taken off the hook on the collection part of it Not every county will participate Every county has
a different way of doing this So that's why I can't tell you exactly how this works but the first conversation is with baby mama to see if she'll even agree to
it in the beginning in the first place and many times you probably won't Okay so if that's the case how else can you
have this removed off your personal credit Well there's a dispute process which you know again is a shot It's not
necessarily going to come off your credit but you could try to dispute it with Experian Equifax and TransUnion You
could say it's inaccurate information and needs to be investigated You could also do the envelope strategy where you
send a certified letter So this is after the first days investigation period with Experian Equifax TransUnion If
nothing happens to positively and favorably update this on your credit report then you need to send this with a
letter a debt validation letter which again I now have available to you at
getdisputellets.com which is down below You can get that letter put it in this envelope Can be a number envelope
Doesn't have to be this big And you send one of these to the court to the actual courthouse they sign for this and then
they're going to have to validate the debt Now if they're not able to come up with any legitimate validation which
sometimes they're not sometimes they don't respond at all or they give you something halfass like a statement
remember what I talked about with statements that statements don't count folks Okay So if they if you get this
back say they signed for this on the st and it's the th and you didn't receive
anything or you didn't receive anything valid as per federal law then you send a
copy of this and you send a copy of the letter that was in here to Experian
Equifax and TransUnion in a dispute letter saying "Hey I sent this letter to
the courthouse." And this also applies to bankruptcies too by the way I sent this to the courthouse Somebody signed
for it on the first Here we are on I would say the st or the st of the following month It's been more than 
days I've gotten nothing They are in violation of federal law and all the statutes are located in your dispute
letters And because they did not respond then this needs to be removed off my personal credit So the problem though
with certain kinds of debt like for example if you had a credit card a defaulted credit card that fell off your
credit and say ABC Collection Agency bought that debt and they put it back on your credit report if you could show proof that it came off which is why I
tell everybody to save save every scrap of paper you get from the credit bureaus and pay basically anybody in this
process because if you could prove that it fell off as per federal law they can't put it back on your credit because
it's already come off right Even if it's a different collection agency if it's the same originating debt they cannot
put it back on your personal credit reports Okay So it's different though with student loans and it's different
with even the IRS but it's also different with you know child support So
they can continue putting it it can continue bouncing back on your credit So
please be warned that that might be the case That might actually end up happening to you And don't be shocked and don't be amazed And of course you
could always try to go back and dispute saying "Hey wait a minute This already fell off days ago Here's proof that you guys took it off take it off because
and you could try the whole federal law thing Sometimes they might do it Sometimes they might take it back off again Sometimes they might not But don't
be surprised if it doesn't stay off because with student loans with child support and with the IRS or other even
state tax obligations that stuff usually doesn't stay off It'll it'll keep coming back on which is why you want to get
ahead of these types of things These are the three the three things that you're going to have to try to figure out how
to how you can make good on so that you can you know either have it completely removed like the child support you want
that removed completely or IRS debt you want that completely removed or even
state tax obligations completely removed or if it's a student loan situation you want it to positively update on your
personal credit reports as in the consolidation strategy that I that I showed you before So that is the way to
get these hard difficult things off your credit And yeah it's probably not the song and dance you wanted to hear You
probably wanted to hear how I can you know give you a magic wand and you can just make it all disappear But that's not the reality So if you're
one of these people and you're like "Well Monica I really need to start making some more money so I can sub you know send in the child support payments
or the IRS payments or whatever the case may be
