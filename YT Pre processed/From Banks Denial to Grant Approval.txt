From Banks Denial to Grant Approval: The Secret Hack Nobody Shares!
credit doesn't play a role in getting approved for a grant Correct because if a person let's say apply for a
traditional loan they may get denied because of their credit but if they get everything in place for their business
or for their nonprofit then there's a chance that they can just get approved for the grant Correct Regardless of their credit
That's correct So grants are not loans and they're not based on personal credit They're they're based on
Hey what's going on guys calvin Russell here Super excited to bring you all yet another guest speaker All right So
listen This young man has been helping a lot of people get government grants okay
for their nonforprofits as well as their businesses Okay So uh listen a lot of
people have been trying to figure out how can they do this Well listen get your notepads out He does not have a lot
Introducing Dr Marlon Hayward
of time but listen he will be able to stick around and answer a few questions for our Club elite Uh of course
that'll be after this interview But listen let's go and get right into it I most definitely want to take as much time as we can okay with him But let's
go and introduce you all to Mr uh Dr Marlon Hayward Dr Can you hear us okay Mr Hayward Yep I can hear you All right
Can Can you hear me absolutely We sure can man How's your day going so far you know what it's great It's the weather is
is great So anytime it's nice it's sunny outside is always a good day for me
There we go man Finally Especially in Chicago man We don't get good weather often So we better squeeze these three
months as much as we [Laughter] can All right Awesome Awesome Well listen Dr Haywood first off I want to
say thank you for uh making some time you know out of your schedule to go ahead and just give us uh the game on
how we can go ahead and start qualifying for you know some of these grants and different programs that are available
Starting a nonprofit
But a lot of people just don't know you know how to get approved for them and what they're looking for But you've been
able to get over eight figures you know in grants and such Let's go and take it
a step back Okay What made you like even start your own nonforprofit and then
essentially say "Okay you know what i think I'm going to need some funding here." Um well you know what originally
when I started I started it because I just wanted to make a difference right i didn't know anything about starting a
nonprofit I didn't know anything about grant writing Um for me I just looked at
the need and I said "How can I meet the need?" Um I used to go to a local elementary school high school when I was
in college at niu with the center for black studies And that was something
that again I just looked at it as it was a passion something I cared about and how can I make a difference it was when
I graduated from college and I started working at Malcolm X College that I had a friend shout out to Ladies of Virtue
uh Jamila Trimu who said "Hey I I have a an law firm that's looking to help
individuals start up their nonprofit pro bono Uh do you have an interest?" And I'm like "Absolutely." So that is
literally how I got started um in turning Urban Mail Network into a nonprofit because a friend our sister
organization Ladies of Virtue looked out and said "Here's an opportunity to establish your organization as a c"
Wow Wow Yeah Ain't that something so really just knowing people at a specific
Getting approved for grants
time it just puts you in a position where it's like "Okay let's go ahead and take this you know to another level."
Okay So now of course let's fast forward this a bit Um over the years you've gotten you know approved for grants and
you know you've obviously secured funds and things of that sort but it wasn't always that easy Can you tell us how it
was before that time frame when you said "Okay you know what i need to kind of figure this whole thing out." You know
it's never easy I mean for the longest I was paying for things out of my own pocket uh doing GoFundMe and I would
just ask for different donations and for people to support the ideas and the
programs that I had And a lot of times I had to charge the participants which I didn't want to do because sometimes you
know or a lot of times people didn't have the money to afford the programs that we were offering and and the people
who need it the most oftentimes are the people who cannot afford it and and that was kind of what led me into the route
of trying to figure out how can I get more funding well I was working at Rush University Medical Center for for a while If you're looking to get funding
for your business with no minimum credit score required this includes term loans equipment financ and even fix and flip
loans as well To learn more scan this QR code or click the link in the description below Now back to the video
And Rush actually supported and backed a lot of our programs and initiatives in the beginning stages of Urban Mail
Network getting started I left Rush I started working for this nonprofit um I'm not going to name the nonprofit
organization but after a year um you know I got they they cut my position you
know they try to take over they asked to try to they asked about how do I feel
about bringing Urban Mail Network under them I said no and then probably about a
month or two months later I get called into the office and and they're saying hey we no longer need you anymore wow
position has been cut but while I was there The interesting thing about my role and my position there for this this
nonprofit is that I was a director uh for community engagement and outreach So
I was they had me on the fund development team where I had to learn about grant writing government contracts
how all of that works So because that was my role in my position Yeah I began
to learn about how government contracts works for nonprofits and then how to go
about doing grant writing So I'm like "Wow this is you know this is not so bad I can actually do this for myself." So
when I got let go I ended up literally um I said "You know what i'mma just take
this time." Yeah Because I was getting an appointment right at that So I said "I'm gonna take this time and I'm going
to just focus on building up my own organization." Yeah Start you know submitting for grants I start really
setting up our the foundation for the organization to then go after government funding Of course you know the first few
months you know were the first few times we got denied but then eventually things started to work out Um and here we are
about three three years later um where we have what eight full-time staff members uh three part-time and you know
so just we offer more programs and services that we're offering So since I've been laid off you know the
organization has been able to expand and take off in a different level Wow that's
amazing man And that's a great story to hear especi because you know you don't hear every day doctors being you know
like fired or laid off or anything like that you know that's the whole point of you know actually achieving that level
as well too congratulations on that by the way because I remember you know when you was just Marlin not not Dr hat Okay
So but what I love about you man is that you haven't changed you know over the years and you just continue to pour into
Naming a street after his grandmother
uh you know the youth and just really giving people you know um just a glimpse of light especially in Chicago where a
lot of just one of the many cities that people just give a bad rap to you know for a lot of these kids but you're doing
so much so much Uh and then they also named a street after your grandmother Is that correct yeah So that that kind of
goes into another story about connecting with government agencies and entities So we uh were donated a vacant lot on the
block that I was raised with my grandmother So I grew up with my grandmother in the same house with Cook
County Land Bank um in partnership with Rage donated about nine vacant lots to
residents in that community So the thing is that we got this vacant lot We was one of the nine you know people real
quick Be sure to download our free ebook today All you got to do is scan this QR code right here or click the link in the
description below Now back to the video And I'm like "Okay great." So I ended up then once I got the lot I then submitted
a proposal or for a grant um opportunity to the city of Chicago So I ended up
getting the grant for Urban Network and then um to redevelop the lot So we end
up changing this vacant parking lot into a basketball court And we did a mural on
the court We put you know a fence a gate around it and did a mural on the front of it We put lights and electricity out
there And then the second phase of it was that we was able to name the street after her as well So if you ride by
there you will see her face and her name on this basketball court like on the you know like the wooden gate before you
walk in Yeah And then um on the street that the name the street is named after her as well Wow You know it's crazy man
Overqualified
because that's the type of stuff you see on movies you know or people of celebrity stature but it's not just that
You you you are really making an impact and continuing you know to do that you know as well But let's let's go let's
get back back into I just want to kind of set the stage so people know you're not just because a lot of times people
are just giving information they get one grant and all of a sudden they're a grant coach right um but you've gotten
you've secured over eight figures of funding You've bought prop and by the way I've seen this everyone that's
watching this I've seen this I'm talking about buying properties with grant funding right u renovating them So
listen he's being modest but we going we going to get some we going to get some juice out of this today you know for sure But I'm just letting people know
listen overqualified to talk about this type of stuff and he continues to do this as well Let's go and get into a
couple of questions here One do you have to be in business a certain amount of time before you qualify for most
government grants you do not There is no qualification that says you have to be in business for a certain amount of time
However you know when it comes to writing the proposals they do ask about your level of experience
when you are submitting for these proposals So how long have you been doing this work what makes you the
expert right in the topic that you are submitting for or the issue that you're
trying to address what I tell people often right sometime people feel like well I haven't really been doing this
but if you have volunteered maybe it may not you may not have been paid or if you
have experienced it so if you were homeless and then now you're trying to serve the homeless population well let's
say if you was homeless for seven and eight years well then you understand that population that you're trying to serve because you was once a part of
that demographic so you can speak to that so there's various ways that even if you're just recent recently starting
your cor your business You know you can speak to the work that you've been doing whether that is as a volunteer um
or as a person who has been a part of the demographics or the population that you're looking to serve And another
thing too right you can always um do what I call a co-sponsored initiative right so you can co-sponsor a proposal
with a nonprofit that has more experience and then that can kind of help with the leverage of of co-art
partnering with a with another nonprofit to submit a proposal that way Wow Okay
Documentation
So you guys heard it here first You don't necessarily have to have be in business for a specific period of time
Uh depending on of course you know which route you guys are trying to go you know for sure So man that's some good
information to have Um as well one of the another question that I see that a lot of people end up having is okay I
want to obviously get approved I know there's some grant writing in the process but what what type of documentation um or qualifications do
people need to have in place when they say okay I'm now about to apply What do they need to have in place beforehand so
typically you know when you're talking about when you're now about to submit or you're looking to submit for the a grant
proposal in general right what is that that correct yeah Okay So I mean there's there's a a few things that that you
would need depending on the the funer Sometime they want to see your um tax returns So um there may be a requirement
that you may you know have to be within a certain range like you can't make over this or maybe they want to have a
minimum amount that um you need to have to apply So tax returns from the
previous year is is one Um another one is a document oftentimes that shows that
you are a cuh organization that you're taxexempt So they will ask for that And then your
paperwork you know showing that you have filed within the state So your articles of organization or incorporation
depending on how you say it That that paperwork um is definitely needed Your EIN number I mean you're going to
definitely need to to know that information And then your board of directors who you know give information
about the board your leadership team So that can be for your executive director CEO to CFO COO They oftentimes ask
information about those individuals So it's good to have bios for each of those
people right that you can kind of give them and and then also typically to have information about your staff Now to kind
of go a step further what I do is is that I typically like to put like a one or two pager together that gives an
overview of the organization So that's talking about the work that we have done the demographics that we serve or
currently serving and then the partners that we have other funders that we have
received money from and then maybe just a breakdown of the budget when it comes to the amount of money that you're
applying for So let's say if it's a $grant or $they want to see okay give us a breakdown right about
what it is that you're planning to do with this And then they want to see a narrative with that particular budget So
this is just kind of giving you high level because depending on the grant it could be a lot more that goes into it
And then another thing that I tell people is that you never want to be the best kept secret And what do I mean by
that is that if you're now submitting for you know a grant but then I go
online and I can't find anything about your organization that's a problem If I'm going on Facebook I'm going on
Instagram yeah LinkedIn or whatever and then nothing has been updated in months
or up to a year That doesn't show me you are an active and engaged organization
Um if I'm a reviewer you got to think about it the reviewers are human And so oftentimes what's the first thing people
gonna do they're going to go to Google they're going to go look and I'm looking I'm like they haven't put nothing out
there so are they really in months right as they say they are so these are all things that you want to make sure your
website I mean these are just simple things that people really miss right and
you know you should have a website and then I tell people another thing is is that you should have a a domain name to
whatever organization that you have established so for example is mine is
maron you know urban mailwork.org Right Right So if somebody when I'm sending an
email then it ties back to show like oh we're a legitimate organization We have
you know Urban Mail Network Instagram Urban Mail Network Chicago Facebook page So these are things that we have So
everything is kind of coinciding So somebody going out there looking they can see that hey we actually doing this
work and we are true and legitimate organization for what we're asking for
money to do Man absolutely I'm so glad you brought that up because I know that there are a lot of there's a lot of just
Trump Administration
regular businesses that don't have an updated social media page updated
website showing what they're doing And when you're especially when you're talking about getting approved for some
type of grant approval and you just don't you're not showing them that like you said there are humans that are doing
this to make sure that you are who you say you are because I'm sure there are people who apply for grants and they may
not be you know legitimate you know so and they're trying to weed those type of people out as well By the way I did want
to mention because you did come out with um a stepbystep guide So if you guys want to learn more about this you guys
can scan the QR code right here at the bottom The link is also going to be in the description below as well But he
actually created a stepbystep guide that walks you through this entire grant process Okay so again he's been approved
for over eight figures of grants So listen this is some stuff that actually works Now I did have another question
for you too Marlin and that is I know the Trump administration has made some
major changes you know just grant approvals and things of that sort How have you seen that affect the grant
approval industry or have you seen that affect much of anything as of right now it has not affected us Um there is still
a lot of funding out there from the Biden administration right from the American Rescue Act I want to say those
funds probably will not expire maybe until like the end of and then we
may start seeing an effect you know from that But right now there's still funds
that are left over from the Biden administration from that he put out there through that American Rescue Act
And then people also have to remember too is that you know when it comes to government funding the city the state
and the county are still able to generate their own funds right through the tax dollars that they raise So
through tax dollars that they raise right from their constituents and the taxes that they charge they can then
decide to say hey this is how we want to allocate this budget So if we was to give an example and take this a little
deeper in the city of Chicago I don't know if you remember maybe a few months ago at the beginning of January there was this whole budget fight with it was
the alman and the mayor and why is because they want they there was a big
fight on the table about raising property taxes Yeah A lot of people was up in Upro were about that because they
was like "Well right now you know our property you know bills and mortgage and everything is already high Raising our
property taxes is just going to make it unaffordable where we're not going to be able to afford it." Well the thing is
they was able to come to an agreement where I think they put you know extra money or they end up raising fair when
it came to like Uber maybe pickup something like that They gonna still figure out a way to tax you They just
didn't do it for Chicago gonna figure it out Well here's the thing Out of that particular budget the mayor for example
right like he decided hey I want to put X amount of dollars towards workforce development for youth So then now they
have you know they put out RFPs which is request for proposal for organizations to apply for funding um when it came to
workforce development for youth in the city of Chicago Now those those
particular dollars again came from the city of Chicago through their tax dollars and that money that was
allocated So that's just kind of to give you an example of how you know the city
the state and the county can still decide right based on that budget what
it is they want to allocate money towards Now when they get money from the federal uh government it does help It
does give an increase in dollars because the federal government does provide funding for them to then provide more
money to different initiatives such as development you know whether that can be development of property buildings like I
don't I don't know if you've seen like how there's been development with new buildings like in the city of Chicago
like they have through the department of y I think I'm saying it right but that could have came from the federal
government and then to the local right to where now they're distributing this
money out that way Wow man But you know what and you know what it takes first
off first off listen let me know in the comments section if you guys want us to bring Marlin back okay because again
this is someone who's seen it from different standpoints Some people just learn about grants because they say
"Okay I need to get grants." But you learned about it prior to that But you're seeing it from so many different perspectives like you just mentioned
where you know if it's something that could benefit the community the neighborhood and instead of people just using their own funds like you said some
of this stuff could have been you know paid for just with grants But you know and again I tell people all the time we
don't know what we don't know Okay And I did want to confirm this because I'm
sure some of the guests may have this question as well too You know credit doesn't play a role in getting approved
for a grant Correct Because if a person let's say applied for a traditional loan they may get denied because of their
credit if they get everything in place for their business or for their non uh
profit then there's a chance that they can just get approved for the grant Correct Regardless of their credit
That's correct So grants are not loans and they're not based on personal credit They're they're based on the work of the
organization the impact that they're making and their qual and then the qualification and the structure that
they have in place to carry out the task that they're that they're trying to do That is you know um typically where like
how grant dollars are distributed So again it's it's money that you don't have to pay back It's not a loan So for
example as you kind of mentioned earlier Yeah you know we got the land through Cook County Land Bank We got a building
from Cook County Land Bank and then we were able I wrote another grant you know and I wrote that to Foot Locker and then
we was able to get that funding to then pay for the development So we don't owe anything So we have this this basketball
court now We owe Z on it We have the building that's almost finished It's it's a foot building but by the
time it's completed we won't owe we don't have a loan Wow On on that building And then you know I had wrote a
grant to get a passenger school bus We don't owe anything that you know we got a van We own it right out We got a
game trailer So we we found a trailer on Facebook Market converted it and turned
it into a game trailer And again we own it right out So these are things that I've been able to do you know through
grant writing and and looking for grants And you know it's it's a numbers game as I call it right you're not going to do
everything that you apply for but you have to be consistent You have to be diligent And one of the things that I do
is that I I typically ask for feedback So if we don't receive a grant now not all the time do they give you feedback
but sometimes they do right you got to stay on them I'll be like "Can you provide feedback?" And then I take that
and I say "Okay well let me look at this next grant that I'm applying for and then see how I can approve on this."
Because again you know I may apply for five and only get one But hey that's great right maybe that one grant is two
two $It's just how it works out Um and then you may apply for five and get
three out of the five right or sometime you might get all five It just depends But you keep going and you keep being
consistent and you know you'll eventually get what is needed for you Man that's amazing That that really is
amazing And I honestly just to see everything unfold you know is has been amazing to watch as well too you know
What is an unrestricted grant
knowing you So let me ask this question too I know that there are people watching this that say "Okay you know
what i know I'm more than likely going to need some source of transportation
you know for my business or nonprofit I know that it would be great to have uh
put myself in a position where I can get a building Can you walk us through not every single step but what that process
was like is it the same as asking for or I would say applying for just a normal
grant or was it different because you were trying to get um a transportation vehicle or the property was that process
any different it is different Right So you have some grants They're they're
very strict about what it is that you can do with the money right so some grants yeah you cannot buy vehicles you
can't go purchase real estate you can't go do development But one of the things is is that I would tell people go look
for what is called a unrestricted grant An unrestricted grant is that a grant to
where they don't restrict what you can do with the dollars So if you need to buy a van if you need to buy a car to
transport people or maybe you need to buy a building then you can do that with those unrestricted dollars Um and so
that's why it's very um important that you're literally looking at the type of grants that you are applying for So then
you understand what it is you can do and what you cannot do Because again you know some grants don't allow you to
purchase and do something like some grants you can't buy food where some can't right so it it just depends and
you just have to understand what is it you know that that you are I put in there So I tell people and here's a a
gym that I would drop right so let's say we have business owners on on your call which I'm sure you do Um and I will tell
people is that they should start a cwhich is a nonprofit and then they should have the forprofit side which is
your LLC So you can have the same name So let's just say if I had Heywood LLC
and then if I had Heywood NFP which is Haywood Notforprofit Now I don't have neither one of those but I'm just giving
an example Yeah But Haywood you know not for profofit can then be applying for
funding and grants that that only gives money to a cBut I can still have
Haywood LLC to then do the for-profit business work that I want to do Well with the nonprofit side I can then be
applying for funding let's say for a space to provide service whether that's to youth to seniors whatever it is that
I'm trying to do right and then let's say now you got the funding for it and then you can pay for your rental of a
space or office And then you know you can also then have your for-profit
business then being housed in that same building But then now you know if you think about the biggest expenses that
people need to pay right as a business owner it is a space whether that is you
know as a as a store retail office but then if you're able to now get that covered and you don't have to you know
take care of that that could be something that you can you know get taken care of Wow Listen I hope you guys
Summary
didn't miss that gem For those who didn't I'm going to give you the summary Okay If you have a business you should
strongly consider adding a nonprofit to that business And you say it could even
have the same name That is man that's crazy And I remember just a conversation I was having with you to add to that
where you were you had mentioned that if the if the nonforprofit needs something
and it has to get it done from a contractor and if your business just so
happens to be it can solve that situation You're essentially able to pay the business you know at know as a
contractor using those government funds assuming of course everything makes sense to do so man that that was amazing
you know within itself So and then last but not least before we get up out of here uh Dr Haywood I did have another
question as well too Um what are some are there any other common mistakes i know you talked about the website and
things of that sort Anything else that you see that people make mistakes on and it really keeps them from getting
approved getting approved for a grant or getting approved for the non not forprofit Which one you know let's go
ahead and go with just for grants for now Okay Um I mean it could be a lot of things right it can be the the deadline
because this has happened to me right let's say the deadline was today okay p.m Well you submitted it at
Well then they send you back an email saying "Well you didn't meet the deadline right?" A lot of these funders
be very meticulous and they're very strict about the deadline Um so if you know that you have a problem with
meeting deadlines then give yourself the deadline the day before That's that's number one Number two um when it comes
to just the budget right um like how how when it comes to putting together the
budget like you have to make sure that you're putting together a budget that makes sense for the amount of money that
you are asking for or the money that they're allowing you to ask for And if they're looking at your budget and it
doesn't make sense um you're not able to explain what you're trying to do for the funds that can be something that can be
to to a mistake And then another thing too is that when you are being too general and broad but you're not being
specific enough So if you say "I just want to help the community." Well how do you want to help the community what
particular community do you want to help and then tell me about the community that you want to serve right what is the
issue but if you're just saying "I want to solve homelessness." Well that's broad You got to be more specific Give
me data Give me information And then once you give me the problem then lay it out how your organization and the money
that you're being provided is going to then help solve or kind of be a part of
the solution So make sure that you're able to do those things And sometime people just make mistakes of being too
broad too general and then not getting specific in the weeds There you go Listen you guys are you guys are getting
a master class you know on this you know for sure Well listen uh Dr Hey we greatly appreciate you uh being here as
well And then also to everyone that's watching this he does have a stepby-step guide that not only walks you through
how he was able to get up to eight figures into funding but also how to we
didn't go too deep into how to start the nonprofit and things of that So I really want to just focus on the grant piece
