How to properly "Discharge & Offset Debts" in the U.S.: Steps including the use Promissory Notes!!!
discharging what is that discharging is
the fact that
by law we don't have money money implies
that
there is gold silver copper jewels
you know something
based or backed behind it to give it its
value
paper especially federal reserve notes
are
printed
to be
promises to pay in the future
so
what is that a promise to pay in the
futures is credit
they say this is good
even though it's a piece of paper
and at the bank or like the knights
templar
you can take it to a castle or whatever
else which is where the first banking
really came from and that you can redeem
it for lawful money lawful money is
different than
the legal tender that we are using okay
all that can really be considered
currency
so
one of the ways that people have and
we've already talked about this video
um i might put the
educational information back up on my
site because people have been asking me
for my version of the promissory notes
uh once again we don't i don't make any
guarantees that it's going to work for
you because some of the banks are shady
and depending on how you use them the
people that you're sending them to may
not know how to process the information
so that is contained
in the areas where we've been successful
with them in that package
we've been selling it bucks privately
so that might be
back on the website at some point in
time
otherwise i did show you guys videos on
how to find them and make your own
now with the promissory note you have to
understand that
only the banks really know how to
monetize or securitize those things they
already do it with your house note okay
which is where the fraud comes in
because they didn't tell you that they
were going to do that
um and then all the other fraud that
goes on along behind there so look up uh
what is it uh regulation z in the uh
mortgage lending okay i also taught you
guys how to look up your banks to see if
all the other cases they've lost in
federal or supreme court about the fraud
they've done
consult me for a little more information
on that
um
otherwise in general yes promissory
notes typically will work for banks
loans things of that nature
other entities it's harder to do with
them with them because you'd have to
make it payable to them and then
give them the information that they need
to then send it to their bank but a
higher up to then process it and then
it's still going to take days for
them to monetize it i know this because
smells wargo vp called me and said they
were going to monetize mine and then
when the time came they reneged on the
offer fraud extended kept the note
that is a violation of law okay and
theft and deception and all that other
good stuff all right but anyway so
um have we been successful yes of all
mine especially from back in the day
have been done and have been successful
and a large number of them i probably
say to people
percent of people um have used them and
they've been successful but only when
dealing with direct bank related things
now obviously because we're sharing
their dirty little secret um some have
decided to not be honorable because they
weren't honorable in the first place
um but like i said we've made videos on
that so that is still an option but
obviously we can't make any guarantees
because each individual institution
decides what what they want to do
and what not okay
so one of the next options you can use
for discharging your debts would be the
c
um
Cancellation
the c stands for cancellation that means
that
i have provided you with credit
okay
nine times out of ten you it was your
signature your signature and your social
that provided them the credit for what
they did
um
banks are forbidden from loaning money
and assets okay
especially lawful money they're not
going to give you anything that's
actually worth gold they're going to
give you
credit where did that credit come from
nine times out of ten it came from the
promissory note that you signed they
used your social security number to
access certain accounts okay educational
information only from favorite
non-believers not combatant treaties
united states and private citizen
um so in you providing them with credit
uh they then gave it back to you and
then now you're actually paying for the
service that they provided
all right so in sending whoever it is
your creditor at c
this is this the c stands for
cancellation so you're telling me i've
paid you
i want any recoupment that i'm um
entitled to and then i want to cancel
the contract between us
now
i personally have not done this this
will be a potential next step
and by that i mean for a house because
if you're still paying on a house and
you send them a c
they
i've just i've just personally never
done that particular aspect of it other
people i know have done it for other
things with c and were successful
i've personally never done it with my
own house
most reasons why is because i haven't
found anybody who's done it also with
their house because if you're cancelling
the agreement
they're probably going to try to go
after you and
uh even though they committed fraud and
even though you are the provider of the
credit i just have never done that i
don't want to i don't mind rocking the
boat but i don't like to rock the boat
with where i live when
that scenario now of course yes we do
have the ability to
stay up in court and actually would kind
of be a blessing in disguise because
then we could present the other
information by forcing them to force us
to go to court because then we can use
all of the information that's held in
the higher courts but
they might try to take you to the lower
courts where they're all buddy buddy
with the fake magic the real match rates
fake judges and whatever else so we want
them where court cases matter so that
would be in the federal district court
so that's where you'd want to take them
okay which by the way smells
got a little something coming for you
but anyway let's move on so one of the
IRS Offset
next options people can do to discharge
debts is an irs
offset is what what it's called you can
inform your creditor that you want to
you authorize them to do in
an offset through the irs sometimes it's
called a mutual offset
now when you offset through the irs
um keep in mind that they may
just they'll take that person's offset
authorization for to wipe that debt for
you but it doesn't just go away because
it's going to then appear on your
taxes at the end of the year okay so you
discharge your house through irs offset
you discharge your dental bills or
whatever else which we made a video on
that
um it's going to just transfer on over
now if you do that
educational information only you can set
up a consultation with me and we can
deal with how to handle the irs issue at
the end of the year but only done in
private and that's educational
information yes it has been successful
um but we like to not put on all the
information out there
um it's just how it is okay or you can
just deal with it yourself you know
there's other ways you can talk to your
uh lawyer or your attorney lawyer tax
guy whoever else and
you know make things happen to offset
once again some things just leave it at
that
all right
so one of the last ones that's been used
since time and time again a lot of you
guys didn't know this um
i'm actually in the process of doing
this right now with the
abode we shall say
um domiciled into private
is
hjr
or public law -
now
HJR 
it depending on your level of reading
and understanding this information um
understand that this is um
trying to give you the short version of
it
it's a
your right to authorize the discharge of
a debt through the treasury
because under hjr public laws -
it states that all public u.s
obligations or debts
are then obligations of the u.s treasury
payable by the secretary of treasury
okay
so
there's a lot of
words and there's a lot of information
when if you read the full article um
but essentially
once we got off the gold standard we
were put into a position where we they
took our gold and that gold is still
accumulating interest so
that sitting there the determination
between in congress and in the house
joint and all that was that um
all of our debts are supposed to be
prepaid
okay but all of our
straw man nondagor war name
in latin
um

your legal name that legal entity so all
of those debts by your name and all
uppercase lettering
and to some degree i guess you could
kind of slosh in upper and lower case
um because those are all your public
transmitting utilities these are
your name that was transmuted into their
property okay as a federalized state
employee
so by having that there's one reason why
i tell people not to necessarily
renounce or because you're throwing away
some benefits and privileges that you
might want to use
so
um
okay so with that being said the those
are those public entities okay the debts
that
you have acquired as a
surety or an authorized agent who should
assume no financial or physical
liability for
have
when you purchase your stuff you
transmit it you transmit it into your
that trust that business trust that they
set up for you okay now it is considered
to be their debt so yes your house your
car your phone all stuff that you bought
with your name and all capitalized
letters or a combination thereof
essentially moved into that business
trust so that it owns it you don't own
it
you don't own it until you transfer that
stuff out into the
private trust that you create without
using your same exact name
okay give it a different name otherwise
you're transferring it out and then
right back into the same
business trust that you want to get away
from it from in the first place excuse
me allergies
um
Public Law 
so when you look up that resolution
especially public law -and there's
another one that goes by i don't
remember that one
um you can authorize your creditors to
by sending them a letter stating that
information that you want to you're
authorizing them to discharge it through
that now educational information only
you can send that directly to
the company but you want to make sure
that it goes to
the higher ups okay at least the cfo
anybody else is probably not going to
understand that information or you can
send it directly to the treasury
attention to the secretary of the
treasury
and from there
it might take some time but you should
hear back from them and by time i do
mean
it will probably take you nine months to
a year maybe even a year
and a half
okay i'm still waiting to hear back on
something that i'm
discharging
and so it's gonna take time
all right so back in the day a lot of
people i older gurus if you will
once again i'm definitely not a guru um
told me that when they did it that it
used to be quick
and painless and now it's a little bit
more arduous which is why a lot of
people including myself kind of stop
doing those little processes and just
you know either discharge this way or
just pay it whatever your your call your
choice your information all right
Conclusion
so
that is pretty much it guys those are
all the top ways um i know some people
had inquired about the boe
so the boe is just a bill of exchange
it's underneath the term negotiable
instrument already made videos on this
and but the boes are for purchasing okay
i will tell you honestly i have not used
a boe to actually purchase anything
um why
because when i discharged all my other
stuff i was just happy i was like i'm
good
it's legal nobody came bothering me it
was accepted hell i even got accredited
at one place so i was like i'm good i'm
done
that doesn't mean that you can't
research it it doesn't mean that i won't
research it in the future but you know
do your due diligence and as always guys
before you do somebody's
process make sure that you at least
contact these agencies to make sure that
they understand what's going on what
you're doing and don't get me wrong
i know what some of you guys are going
to say especially about the bonds
um
remember the low-level people who are
going to be answering the phone don't
know what's going on so i tell people
don't even bother go and see what you
have on the account and call today don't
bother me with it because i'm not going
to give you any information if you
bother them with it they're going to
tell you we know what you're talking
about it's all internet
you know crap and whatever else but yet
the accounts pull up
so do you really think that they're
going to tell you over the phone
something that they consider to be
private or trust or secret information
no
all right so i gave you all the
information guys you need to to check it
out other than that i wash my hands
clean of it
um
as a matter of fact keep this in mind a
lot of you guys aren't even in the right
position because you have to understand
that you're going after the very strong
man that you say you're not
you're going after the credit and stuff
within that
and some of you guys haven't even taken
control of your strong man you haven't
confirmed or
acknowledged your age of a majority
none of these things
i'm just going to say so there are more
steps to trying to do certain some of
these things successfully so i'm going
to give and say
um i don't recommend even going after
them in the first place like i said edu
only
that's it
um
so if somebody else knows of any other
discharge methods out there that i did
not mention that you have used and that
are vetted meaning you've done them you
know you're more than welcome to show me
send me some proof
and we'll go from there and then maybe
i'll make a video on it or you know i'll
swap uh information with you in exchange
for that in that confidential piece of
beautifulness
so that's it guys i want to thank you
for watching the bad wolf channel all
right um i got some more videos coming
up i got some lives coming up got some
more files we're going to update
blacksidewith i'm gonna make some
files that um are
need to be free free and we're gonna
charge for some new ones that's how it
works so
that's it don't forget to hit that bell
like subscribe i definitely appreciate
each and every one of you guys um we're
at like i said 
or something like that or 
something like that um like i said next
goal is and i'm just truly
amazed and blessed by each and every one
of you guys if you guys see anybody
using any of my information likeness
symbols logos information in a negative
way
report them with that button over there
or down there for bullying slander
harassment
defamation of character and whatever
else okay so definitely appreciate you
guys in advance especially if they're
using the s word
okay
um because once again sovereign citizen
is an oxymoron you cannot be
a
king and a slave at the same time
it's one or the other where do your
loyalties lie okay
if your slave slave master calls you and
then your queen calls you or king or
whatever you're into
which one are you going to answer
can't be both they both can't have
possession over one one object all right
